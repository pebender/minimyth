          <p>
            Some remote control devices appear as keyboard devices.
            Specifically, they appear as one or more event input devices.
            MiniMyth can treat an event input device as either a remote (handled by LIRC) or a keyboard (handled by Xorg).
            Because MiniMyth is better integrated and tested with LIRC than with Xorg as input,
            I believe that it is better to treat these event input devices as remotes rather than keyboards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, if your remote control is not already known to MiniMyth,
            then treating it as a remote will require some manual configuration.
            Specifically, you will need to provide MiniMyth with
            the name of the LIRC driver that handles event input devices,
            the path to the event input device that corresponds to your remote control,
            the 'lircd.conf' file that maps remote control key presses to key names, and
            (if needed) the 'lircrc' file that maps key names to per-application actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            LIRC handles input event devices such as keyboards using the devinput driver.
            Therefore, you can configure LIRC to use the devinput driver by adding
            <a href="document-minimyth_conf.html#MM_LIRC_DRIVER">MM_LIRC_DRIVER</a>='devinput'
            to your
            <a href="document-configure.html#minimyth_conf">MiniMyth configuration file</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to provide LIRC with the path to the event input device that corresponds to your remote control,
            you must determine the path.
            You can determine the event input device that corresponds to your remote control
            by connecting to your MiniMyth frontend as user 'root' using either
            <a href="document-use.html#access-telnet">telnet</a>
            or
            <a href="document-use.html#access-ssh">ssh</a>
            and looking at the output of the command
          </p>
          <code>
            cat /proc/bus/input/devices
          </code>
          <p>
            In this output, each input device has a separate record.
            Each record is separated by a blank line and each field is on its own line.
            You should be able to recognize the record(s) associated with your device by looking at the name field
            (the field that starts with 'N:').
            If your device is recognized as a keyboard event input device,
            then the handler field (the field that starts with 'H:')
            will contain the entries 'kbd' and 'eventX', where X is a number.
            The 'eventX' corresponds to the remote control's device file system entry '/dev/input/eventX'.
            Therefore, your can configure LIRC to use the device associated with your remote control by adding
            <a href="document-minimyth_conf.html#MM_LIRC_DEVICE">MM_LIRC_DEVICE</a>='/dev/input/eventX'
            to your
            <a href="document-configure.html#minimyth_conf">MiniMyth configuration file</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to provide MiniMyth with an 'lircd.conf' file that maps remote control key preses to key names,
            you must determine the mapping.
            Determining the mapping is two step process:
            (1) use the standard keyboard map to determine the standard key name(s) that are generated when a key is pressed, and
            (2) modify the standard keyboard map so that the key name that is generated corresponds to the key pressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find an 'lircd.conf' file for the standard keyboard map
            <a href="misc/lircd.conf.devinput">here</a>.
            If you name the file 'lircd.conf', put it in your
            <a href="document-configure.html#location">MiniMyth read-only configure directory</a>
            (the same directory as your
            <a href="document-configure.html#minimyth_conf">MiniMyth configuration file</a>),
            and add 
            <a href="document-minimyth_conf.html#MM_LIRC_FETCH_LIRCD_CONF">MM_LIRC_FETCH_LIRCD_CONF</a>='yes'
            to your
            <a href="document-configure.html#minimyth_conf">MiniMyth configuration file</a>),
            then MiniMyth will use this standard keyboard map 'lircd.conf' file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, reboot your frontend.
            If all goes well, lircd should start.
            You can check that it started
            by connecting to your MiniMyth frontend as user 'root' using either
            <a href="document-use.html#access-telnet">telnet</a>
            or
            <a href="document-use.html#access-ssh">ssh</a>
            and running the command
          </p>
          <code>
            ps x ocmd | grep lircd
          </code>
          <p>
            If lircd is running, then you should see the output
          </p>
          <code>
            /usr/sbin/lircd --device=/dev/input/eventX --driver=devinput ..
          </code>
          <p>
            In addition, it is a good idea to make sure that the standard keyboard map 'lircd.conf' file is being used
            by checking that the contents of the '/etc/lircd.conf' file on your MiniMyth frontend
            are the same as the 'lircd.conf' file in your 
            <a href="document-configure.html#location">MiniMyth read-only configure directory</a>.
            Finally, it is a good idea to exit mythfrontend,
            which you can do by connecting to your MiniMyth frontend as user 'root' using either
            <a href="document-use.html#access-telnet">telnet</a>
            or
            <a href="document-use.html#access-ssh">ssh</a>
            and running the command
          </p>
          <code>
            mm_command x_stop
          </code>
          <p>
            Now, you can determine the standard key name(s) that are generated when a key is pressed.
            You can do this by connecting to your MiniMyth frontend as user 'root' using either
            <a href="document-use.html#access-telnet">telnet</a>
            or
            <a href="document-use.html#access-ssh">ssh</a>,
            running the command
          </p>
          <code>
            irw
          </code>
          <p>
            successively pressing each key on the remote control and noting the output.
            When you press a remote control key,
            you should see a output that has the form
          </p>
          <code>
            0000000000010039 00 KEY_SPACE linux-input-layer
          </code>
          <p>
            The key name is the word to the left of 'linux-input-layer'.
            In the above example, the key name is 'KEY_SPACE'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most remote controls that appear as keyboards will generate one key name output per key press.
            However, some remote controls
            (such as remote controls that output the Microsoft Media Center keyboard shortcuts)
            may generate multiple key name outputs per key press.
            If none of the keys on your remote control generate more than one key name output per key press,
            then you will only need to create a custom 'lircd.conf' file.
            If some of the keys on your remote control generate more than one key name output per key press,
            then you will need to create a custom 'lircd.conf' file and a custom 'lircrc' file.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to create a custom 'lircd.conf' file for your remote control,
            the first thing to do is delete all the key name entries from the standard keyboard 'lircd.conf' file.
            If your remote control does not generate more than one key name output per key press for any keys,
            then you should change the key names in the 'lircd.conf' file so that they more correctly correspond to their function
            as this will enable the 'lircd.conf' file to work with MiniMyth's built-in 'lircrc' files.
            If your remote control does generate more than one key name output per key press for some keys,
            then there is no reason to change the key names in the 'lircd.conf' file
            as you will need to create a custom 'lircd.conf' file anyway.
            If you want more information on the 'lircd.conf' file format, you can find it
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/configure.html#lircd.conf_format">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your remote control does generate more than one key name output per key press for some keys,
            then you will need to create a custom 'lircrc' file.
            The reason is that the MiniMyth built-in 'lircrc' files expect one key name per key press,
            and there is no way to use 'lircd.conf' to map multiple key names to a single key name.
            The '/etc/lircrc' on your frontend file contains a list of file names that are the MiniMyth built-in 'lircrc' files.
            You can download these files from your frontend using the
            <a href="http://minimyth.org/document-use.html#access-http">HTTP access</a>
            to the frontend.
            Once you have downloaded the MiniMyth built-in 'lircrc' files,
            you can concatenate them into a single 'lircrc' file.
            After that, you will need to edit this 'lircrc' file,
            replacing, each 'button&nbsp;=&nbsp;{key_name} line with the one or more 'button&nbsp;=&nbsp;{key_name}' lines
            for the one or more key names that correspond to the action.
            For example,
            if the remote control's fast foward key generates the key name sequence KEY_LEFTCTRL KEY_LEFTSHIFT KEY_F,
            then you will want to replace each
            'button&nbsp;=&nbsp;KEY_FORWARD'
            line with the lines
            'button&nbsp;=&nbsp;KEY_LEFTCTRL',
            'button&nbsp;=&nbsp;KEY_LEFTSHIFT' and
            'button&nbsp;=&nbsp;KEY_F'.
            If you want more information on the 'lircrc' file format, you can find it
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/configure.html#lircrc_format">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your remote control was not known to MiniMyth
            and you took the time to create the 'lircd.conf' file and (if needed) the 'lircrc' file,
            then please follow the instructions under
            <a href="document-minimyth_conf.html#MM_LIRC_AUTO_ENABLED">MM_LIRC_AUTO_ENABLED</a>
            for letting us know so that others can benefit from your efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some remote controls appear as multiple keyboards.
            If your remote control appears as multiple keyboard event input devices,
            then there will be multiple records corresponding to your remote control
            in the output of the command
          </p>
          <code>
            cat /proc/bus/input/devices
          </code>
          <p>
            each with a different eventX value.
            If your remote control appears as multiple keyboard event input devices,
            then you will need to repeat the steps for creating the 'lircd.conf' and 'lircrc' for each event input device.
            Additionally, as MiniMyth's manual configuration only supports configuring one LIRC device,
            you will only be able to use one of the event input devices created by your remote control until
            your remote control is known to MiniMyth.
