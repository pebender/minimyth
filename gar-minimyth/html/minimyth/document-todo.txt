Other:
    - Add MiniMyth init check for files that are not SUID but need to be as
      this is an indication that the NFS root file system was incorrectly
      installed using a user other than root.
    - Figure out why Python uses the build system rather than the target
      system as dist-name (even though the shared objects are built for the
      target system).
