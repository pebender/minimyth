    - Added support for the amd64-agp.ko driver.

Modified Xorg
    - Modified the default /etc/X11/xorg.conf file so that it does not auto
      add devices.
    - Replaced the kbd and mouse drivers with the evdev driver.

        - Now, when a device is used by LIRC, it is not used by Xorg.
    - Reorganized detection rules.
        - Renamed udev detection rules from
          04-minimyth-detect-x.rules.disabled to

Modified LIRC
    - Reorganized lirc device names.
        - Converted persistent names from device names to device symbolic links.
        - Moved persistent names into directory /dev/persistent.
    - Reorganized detection rules.
        - Renamed udev detection rules from
          04-minimyth-detect-lirc.rules.disabled to

        - Moved persistent name symbolic link creation to
          03-minimyth-persistent.rules.
    - Reorganized the /etc/lirc.d directory.
        - Renamed some directories to shorten the names:
            /etc/lirc.d/driver.conf.d -> /etc/lirc.d/driver.conf

            /etc/lirc.d/lircrc.d      -> /etc/lirc.d/lircrc
        - Reorganized the lircrc files so that they are grouped by application.
          Each application's lircrc configuration is now in either a single
          file or single directory, making it easier for a user to replace one
          application's lircrc configuration without impacting any other
          application.
        - Shortened the names of the files in the /etc/lirc.d/drivers.conf and
          /etc/lirc.d/lircd.conf directories.
    - Modified lirc device detection so that different build-in lircd.conf files
      can be used for different devices, enabling better support for devices
      that use the devinput driver.
    - Added lircd.conf file for devinput device with a default keyboard map.
    - Added lircd.conf file for remotes that emulate MCE keyboard shortcuts.
        - This has not been tested.
    - Added lircrc entries for remotes that emulate MCE keyboard shortcuts.
        - Because many of these are key combinations, they cannot be mapped to
          the key names used by other remotes.
        - This has not been tested.
    - Modified lircrc entries
        - Added KEY_MP3 (controls music).
        - Added KEY_SUBTITLE (controls cc/teletext/subtitle).
        - Added KEY_TEXT (controls cc/teletext/subtitle).
        - Removed KEY_TELETEXT which does not exist in linux/input.h
    - Added auto-detection of the 'Topseed Cyberlink' remote control.
        - Added entry in 05-minimyth-detect-lirc.rules.
        - Added lircd.conf file.
        - This has not been tested.

Changes since 60 (2008-11-28):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 0.20-softpad: version 0.20.2.softpad, release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082,
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07, and
                                                 softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV 0.20:         version 0.20.2,         release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082, and
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV 0.21:         version 0.21.0,         release-0-21-fixes branch svn 19162
    MythTV trunk:        version trunk.19168    trunk svn 19169

Modified kernel
    - Disabled use of out-of-tree ALSA 1.0.18a drivers as some of the drivers
      fail after suspend-to-RAM.
    - Reverted to kernel 2.6.26 because wake-on-USB doe now work under kernel
      2.6.27.
    - Added patch that may help prevent NFS failures after suspend-to-RAM.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Added VDPAU support to FFmpeg and MPlayer SVN.
        - VDPAU NVIDIA drivers are not included in the binary image.
    - Made sure players are not using libFLAC because FFmpeg's FLAC decoder
      should work.
    - Made sure players are using libFAAD because FFmpeg's AAC decoder lacks
      certain capabilities.
    - Made sure that all are using the shared libdca rather than their
      internal versions of libdca/libdts.
    - Renamed mplayer-stable to mplayer-vld in order to reflect that the only
      reason it continues to be included is because it supports XvMC-VLD.

Modified init
    - Modified init so that it redirects the output of '/usr/sbin/powernowd'
      to /dev/null.
    - Modified init so that it links mplayer appropriate version (mplayer-svn or
      mplayer-vld), which depends on whether or not the MiniMyth is using
      XvMC-VLD for MPEG2 decoding.

Fixed bugs
    - Worked around problem in Sys::Hostname::hostname that caused the perl init
      script to fail when the host name was set using MM_DHCP_HOST_NAME. It
      appears that there is at least one bug in Sys::Hostname::hostname that
      causes the value to be incorrect when the host name is changed after
      Sys::Hostname is loaded.
    - Fixed bug that caused perl init scripts to create '/STDOUT' rather than
      '/var/log/minimyth.log'.
    - Fixed bug that caused MM_MYTHDB_SETTINGS_* variables to fail when using
      perl init scripts.
    - Fixed bug in MiniMyth::mythdb_jumppoints_update.
    - Fixed bug in MiniMyth::mythdb_x_get. This bug could cause the perl init
      scripts to fail with the error message 'configuring video ...'.
    - Fixed bug in the openChrome driver's XvMC-VLD implementation:
      <http://wiki.openchrome.org/pipermail/openchrome-devel/2008-November/000140.html>
    - Fixed bug in the lib/libirman package, which would cause irman to no
      longer work in LIRC.

Modified build system
    - Changed mksquashfs so that it uses more conservative settings. I hope
      that this will reduce the chance of creating bad squashfs images.
    - Removed FFmpeg's dependency on SDL.
    - Removed giflib's dependency on X11.
    - Removed xine-lib's dependency on FLAC.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed bug that caused MythTV trunk to pick up files from the build
      system.
    - Fixed bug that caused there to be no shared library for bzip2.

Moved packages
    Moved mediaplayers/mplayer to mediaplayers/mplayer-vld.

    - Worked around problem caused to the mm_install_* scripts by the fact
      that the dash shell included in Ubuntu is broken.
    - Fixed init so that MM_MEDIA_TV_URL does not need to be writable by
      user 'minimyth' unless mythbackend is enabled (MM_BACKEND_ENABLED='yes'),

    - Removed myth-0.20/* and myth-0.20-softpad/* packages.
    - Removed support for 0.20 from init scripts.
    - Re-added MM_PLUGIN_DVD_ENABLED.

Deprecated sh init scripts
    - Made perl init scripts the default.
    - Deprecated 'minimyth.script'.
        - Users will need to convert from 'minimyth.script' to 'minimyth.pm'.
    - After release 59, support for the sh init scripts and 'minimyth.script'
      will be removed.

Modified udev rules
    - Added autodetection of the TechniSat SkyStar 2 TV USB remote control
      receiver.

Modified Linux kernel
    - Updated unionfs to 2.5.
        - Hopefully, this fixes the kernel oops problem with the 2.6.25
          kernel.
    - Updated kernel to 2.6.27.
        - Hopefully, this fixes the problem with Realtek 8111b/8111c Ethernet
          hardware.
    - Added atl2 and sky2 Ethernet driver.
    - Added smsc47m1 and smsc47m192 drivers.
    - Moved gspca and uvc drivers to their in-tree locations.

Modified NVIDIA video drivers
    - Patched older drivers to so that they work with the Linux kernel 2.6.27.

Modified MythTV
    - Changed init patch so that it does not change "Extra audio buffering"
      default.

Modified udev support
    - Stopped creating udev* links to udevadm.
    - Stopped including udevinfo symbolic link to udevadm in the image.
    - Patched MythTV so that it uses udevadm rather than udevinfo.

Modified MPlayer SVN version
    - Changed it to use the external dvdread libraries.

Modified MiniMyth X support
    - Added support for the radeonhd video driver.
        - To use the radeonhd driver add MM_X_DRIVER='radeonhd' to your
          minimyth.conf file.
        - As with the radeon driver, you will likely need to create a custom
          xorg.conf file.
    - Patched the radeonhd driver with the HDMI-including-audio patch.

Modified MiniMyth configuration
    - Added MM_FLASH_URL for installing Adobe Flash Player.
        - Adobe Flash Player only works with MythBrowser versions after 0.20.
        - Adobe Flash Player only works when the MiniMyth image contains the
          required GTK2 and NSS3 libraries.
        - Adobe Flash Player only works on 32-bit builds.
    - Added MM_PLUGIN_INFORMATION_CENTER_ENABLED for disabling (i.e. removing) 
      the 'Information Center' menu.
    - Added MM_THEME_FILE_MENU_ADD for overriding/extending MythTV theme menus.
    - Changed MM_FONT_FILE_TTF_ADD so that the font files can be located in a
      sub-directory of the MiniMyth read-only configuration directory.
    - Re-added MM_PLUGIN_DVD_ENABLED.
    - Added support for running the 'stop' method if it is included in
      'minimyth.pm'.
    - Changed MM_THEMECACHE_URL='auto' so that it is 'confrw:themecache.sfs'.
        - This was done to enable MiniMyth to save more than one cached theme
          in the file as it is supported by MythTV 0.21.

Modified MiniMyth commands
    - Changed mm_sleep so that is saves the system clock to the hardware
      clock on suspend and sets the system clock to the hardware clock on
      wakeup.
    - Changed mm_sleep so that it restarts commands that it stops using the
      original command line not the default command line.
    - Changed mm_sleep_on_ss so that it daemonizes.
    - Changed mm_ss_suspend so that it daemonizes.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed a bug that caused the MM_PLUGIN_*_ENABLED variables to not work when
      using the perl init scripts.
    - Fixed a bug that caused multiline MiniMyth configuration variables to
      fail when the perl init scripts are to process the variables.

      codecs saving to local boot device to fail.
    - Fixed a bug that would cause the video output to no be configured
      correctly for Intel DVI output when perl init scripts were used.
    - Fixed a bug that caused crond to fail to start when perl init scripts
      were used.

Modified build system

Converted to perl from sh
    - Added MiniMyth perl package.
        - Implements the functions in /etc/rc.d/functions.
            - 'mm_*' maps to 'MiniMyth::*' execpt for 'mm_mythdb_*_dump'
                which maps to 'MiniMyth::mythdb_*_print'
            - Function arguments differ because perl supports types other than
              strings.
            - Function return mechanism differs because perl support
              non-integer return values.
    - Added perl init scripts.

      allowing timing of sh and perl based init scripts.

Modified Linux kernel
    - Updated squashfs to 3.4.

Fixed bugs
    - Changed init so that it creates an empty /etc/g15daemon.conf when
      init determines it needs to run g15daemon and /etc/g15daemon.conf does
      not exist.
    - Added g15daemon's g15plugin_tcpserver because it appears to be needed
      even when the client and server are on the same computer.
    - Patched the Xorg Intel driver with the patch from ticket 16833:
      <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16833> and
      <http://people.freedesktop.org/~jcristau/i830_dsparb_sooner.diff>
    - Fixed typo that caused MiniMyth to not fetch xmodmaprc when present in
      the MiniMyth read-only configuration directory.
    - Fixed variable name error that caused the MM_X_FETCH_XORG_CONF variable

    - Fixed bug in format of the default MM_EXTRAS_URL value.
    - Fixed bug that caused hostname '' to be '?', causing retrieval of
      MiniMyth configuration files to fail.
    - Fixed bug that caused mm_sleep_on_ss to not be stopped at shutdown.

Modified build system
    - Added gar-minimyth-<version>.tar.bz2 to the root file system image so
      that we can know exactly what was used to build the binary.
    - Added build system support for gnash.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed bug that caused minimyth.conf.mk variables to not be included in

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 0.21:  version 0.21.0,      release-0-21-fixes branch svn 18023.
    MythTV trunk: version trunk.17941, trunk svn 17941.

Added Logitech Z-10 support
    - Added G15daemon to support the keys and LCD display, including init
      script for starting and stopping G15daemon.
    - Enabled g15 support in LCDproc, including autodetection using udev.
    - ALSA drivers should already support the speakers.

Improved Xorg keyboard handling
    - Added MM_X_FETCH_XMODMAPRC for fetching the xmodmaprc file.
    - Modified the default xinitrc file so that it loads the xmodmaprc file, if
      present.

Improved Intel graphics support
    - Improved support for Intel Xorg driver configuration during init.
    - Patched Intel Xorg driver so that it supports the XvPreferOverlay
      option.

      and auto deinterlacer values to be rejected.
    - Blacklisted the 8250, 8250_pci and 8250_pnp kernel drivers so that they
      are not loaded by udev.
    - Added KERNEL=="hiddev[0-9]*",SUBSYSTEM=="usb" to the lirc udev rule so
      that the USB DViCO remote can be detected.
    - Converted more of the DViCO remote keys to the LIRC namespace, but there
      are still keys that have not been converted.
    - Added missing imonlcd configuration to the LCDd.conf file.
    - Fixed permission problems with MythTV's config.xml and mysql.txt files
      by giving user 'minimyth' (who runs the mythfrontend and mythwelcome)
      and the user 'root' (who runs mythbackend) separate copies.

Modified build system
    - Removed support for the i386 athlon64 target.
    - Removed support for the x86_64 athlon64 target.

    - Enabled parallel build in packages
        lib/ffmpeg
        lib/libcdio-mini
        perl/perl-XML-SAX
    - Removed execute permissions from the shared libraries, except for the
      ld-linux and libc libraries.

Changes since 55 (2008-07-06):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 0.21:  version 0.21.0,      release-0-21-fixes branch svn 17722.
    MythTV trunk: version trunk.17721, trunk svn 17721.

Added MythTV backend support
    - Added backend init script.
    - Added MM_BACKEND init conf script.
    - Added backend detection based on DVB card being present.

Added DVB support
    - Enabled DVB support in MythTV.
    - Added DVB card support to the udev rules.
    - Enabled the DVB card support in the kernel needed to support the modules
      listed here: <http://minimyth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1804>.

Modified init
    - Added MM_MEDIA_TV_MOUNTPOINT and MM_MEDIA_TV_URL.
    - Updated the values for the MM_VIDEO_DEINTERLACER variable so that they
      match MythTV 0.21 rather than MythTV 0.20.
    - Changed init so that it creates MythTV's config.xml file.
    - Changed init so that it adds LocalHostName to MythTV's mysql.txt file.
    - Moved MythTV's config.xml and mysql.txt file to /etc/mythtv.
    - Added additional checks when mounting the media (MM_MEDIA) shares.
        - Check that the mount exists after mounting.
        - Check that the mount is readable (and writable when needed) by the
          user 'minimyth'.
    - Stopped setting UseChromaKeyOSD in database settings table since it is
      not used in MythTV 0.21 or newer.
    - Disabled MythTV's use of OpenGL vertical sync when the intel Xorg driver
      is used because it does not work

Modified image
    - Switched to the out-of-tree ALSA drivers because they fix a VLC audio
      problem (no audio) on the ASUS A8N-VM CSM.
    - Switched from Busybox's top to procps' top because it is more flexible.
    - Switched from Busybox's ps to procps' ps because MythTV makes system
      calls to ps that fail with Busybox's ps.
    - Added lsof and pmap to the normal image.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed typo in /etc/rc.d/functions.
        - Changed mm_sleep_on_xss to mm_sleep_on_ss.
    - Added trap to the mm_ss_suspend script that kills child processes when
      the mm_ss_suspend script is killed.
    - Added trap to the mm_sleep_on_ss script that kills child processes when
      the mm_sleep_on_ss script is killed.
    - Changed mm_sleep so that it disables and reenables mm_sleep_on_ss when
      mm_sleep_on_ss is running.
    - Switched from Busybox's ps to procps' ps, because MythTV makes system
      calls to ps and expects certain textual output. While such system calls
      should be avoided, the easiest way to deal with it is to provide MythTV
      with the ps that it expects.
    - Fixed problem with VLC playback of flash file playback.
        - Enabled sout (streaming output).

Modified build system
    - Changed how the libtool fix-ups are done.
        - Created the macro FIX_LIBTOOL_HARDCODE that fixes the library path
          hardcoding.
        - Created the macro FIX_LIBTOOL_LIBPATH that fixes the library link
          and run search paths.
        - Created the macro FIX_LIBTOOL that is the combination of the macros
          FIX_LIBTOOL_HARDCODE and FIX_LIBTOOL_LIBPATH.
        - Stopped running autoreconf to fix library link search path since the
          FIX_LIBTOOL_LIBPATH macro should fix it.
            - Packages that patch their autoconf files for other reasons
              continue to run autoreconf.
        - Stopped using custom sed lines to fix library path hard coding since
          the FIX_LIBTOOL_HARCODE macro should fix it.
    - Enabled DVB support in MythTV, making it somewhat easier for those
      building MiniMyth based slave backends that use DVB cards.
    - Enabled the DVB card support in the kernel needed to support the modules
      list here: <http://minimyth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1804>.
    - Added mm_SOFTWARE variable value 'backend' for including MythTV backend
      in the binary image.
    - Changed build system so that it creates symbolic links to config.xml and
      mysql.txt in the /home/minimyth/.mythtv directory.
    - Reverted to GCC 4.3.1 to 4.3.0 because there are some compiler
      optimization compilation problems with MythTV using GCC 4.3.1. Even
      though MythTV has a workaround, it is possible that other packages have
      problems with GCC 4.3.1 as well.
    - Changed binutils, gcc and make packages so that they do not apply their
      respective perl patches when doing a native build.
    - Changed build system so that it copies /root from the dirs directory
      rather than creating it. This makes it easier to add program
      configuration files used by the user root.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed bug that caused libtool to search the wrong library directories,
      sometimes resulting in compilation failure:
          lib/taglib

Changes since 54 (2008-06-15):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 0.21:  version 0.21.0,      release-0-21-fixes branch svn 17450.
    MythTV trunk: version trunk.17452, trunk svn 17452.

Modified media players
    - Added SVN version of MPlayer (the binary is called mplayer-svn) and
      changed it so that it uses the shared FFmpeg library.
    - Changed the Xine library so that it uses the shared FFmpeg library.
    - Updated the shared FFmpeg library.
    - Updated the Xine library.
    - With these changes, MPlayer SVN, VLC and Xine use the same shared FFmpeg
      library.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed bug with using DPMS and the NVIDIA driver.
        - Changed default NVIDIA driver version from 173.14.05 to 169.12,
          since 173.14.05 has the problem and 169.12 does not.
    - Fixed but that caused mm_x_stop function to fail.
        - Changed mm_x_applications_list function so that it cleans up
          whitespace that was confusing the other mm_x_applications_*
          functions.
    - Fixed ASUS M2N-VM DVI audio.
        - Added appropriate module option using a modalias.
    - Fixed e1000e Ethernet driver.
        - Patched the 2.6.23 kernel to include the e1000e Ethernet driver.

Modified build system 
    - Added check to make sure build_GARCH_FAMILY is valid.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed bug that caused pkg-config to find the wrong *.pc files when the
      the user's environment sets PKG_CONFIG_PATH.
        - The build system sets PKG_CONFIG_PATH='' now.
    - Fixed bug in package utils/util-linux-ng that caused its configure
      script to find the wrong vol_id binary.
        - The Makefile file adds $(build_DESTDIR)$(build_elibdir)/udev to the
          path now.
    - Fixed bug that caused build_GARCH_FAMILY to be set incorrectly.
        - Apparently, the output of 'uname -i' is not the same for all Linux
          distributions. Therefore, the value of build_GARCH is used, which is
          based on the output of 'uname -m'.
    - Fixed bug where the compiler would sometimes find the system's libraries
      rather than the MiniMyth compiled native libraries for some packages
      (e.g. system/udev).
        - Patched binutils and gcc so that they use lib not lib64 for x86_64
          libraries.
        - Added LIBRARY_PATH to the build system so that the native compiler
          knows about all the library directories and searches them in the
          correct order.
    - Fixed bug that caused libtool to search the wrong library directories,
      sometimes resulting in compilation failure:
          lib/bluez-libs
          lib/dbus
          lib/libart
          lib/libftdi
          lib/libxml2
          lib/libxslt
          utils/bluez-utils
          xorg-7.3/libXfont
          xorg-7.3/libXinerama
     - Fixed a bug in fetching files from SVN that could cause download
       problems with files such as the net/mount.cifs package files.

        - Changed udev so that it names USB LIRC and USB TTY devices based on
          the USB vendor, product and serial number values. The original
          device name remains as a symbolic link.
        - Changed LIRC init to sort the autodetected LIRC devices by device
          name.
    - Improved LCDproc's consistency across reboot
        - Changed udev so that it names USB LCD and USB TTY devices based on
          the USB vendor, product and serial number values. The original
          device name remains as a symbolic link.
    - Added variable MM_LIRC_DEVICE_BLACKLIST for configuring a list of
          remote control receivers that MiniMyth should ignore.
    - Added variables MM_LCDPROC_DEVICE, MM_LCDPROC_KERNEL_MODULE and
      MM_LCDPROC_KERNEL_MODULE_OPTIONS for providing better configuration of
      LCDproc devices.

Added initial VLC support
    - It is experimental and may be removed in the future without warning.
    - It builds.
    - It runs but with some problems.
    - DVD playback on my VIA EPIA SP8000E crashes.

Improved build system
    - Separated Qt 3 and Qt 4 into separate staging directories so that the
      final image can contain both Qt 3 and Qt 4.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed build problem with system/irserver for x86_64 targets.
    - Fixed MythTV ARCH detection problem when building for x86_64 on i386.

      order to avoid multiple FFTW libraries in the distribution.
        - MythMusic used libfftw3 previously.
        - MythStream used libfftw previously.

Improved Xorg

Changed Xorg and Mesa
    - Patched Mesa with <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13541>
      in order to fix some GL/GLX related crashes.
    - Re-included unichrome_dri.so since the Mesa patch appears to have fixed
      the UI crashes and video renderer fallback to OpenGL has already by
      patched.
    - Switched back to Xorg 7.3 in order to overcome a crash when using the
      program guide on at least some VIA hardware.

Improved build system
    - Added initial support for Qt 4 that will soon be required by MythTV trunk.
        - While the build system supports both Qt 3 and Qt 4, you cannot have

    MythTV 0.21:         version 0.21.0,         release-0-21-fixes branch svn 16577.
    MythTV trunk:        version trunk.16588,    trunk svn 16588.

Improved init
    - Changed init to create video playback profile name 'MiniMyth' for MythTV
      0.21 and trunk based on MiniMyth configuration variables.
    - Added MM_VIDEO_PLAYBACK_PROFILE for configuring the video playback profile
      in MythTV 0.21 and trunk.

Enhanced MPlayer
    - Added DVD navigation support. When MythTV's internal player does not play
      a DVD or DVD ISO correctly, I use the following MPlayer commands instead:
        - For a DVD
          mplayer -fs -quiet -nocache -vfm ffmpeg -vo xv dvdnav://0 -dvd-device /dev/dvd
        - For a DVD ISO
          mplayer -fs -quiet -nocache -vfm ffmpeg -vo xv dvdnav://0 -dvd-device %s
    - Changed LIRC KEY_UP, KEY_DOWN, KEY_LEFT, KEY_RIGHT, KEY_OK and KEY_DVD
      so that they control DVD navigation functionality.
    - It crashes when either XvMC or XvMC-VLD is enabled. I have no looked
      into the cause.
    - If you are using Xine for DVD playback and you do not require XvMC or
      XvMC-VLD support, then please try using mplayer instead. As some point
      in the future, I would like to remove Xine.

Removed packages
    Removed lib/libdvdread (included in lib/libdvdnav).

Added packages
    Added lib/libdvdnav.

Updated packages
    Updated disk/e2fsprogs.

                                                 softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV 0.20:         version 0.20.2,         release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082, and
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV 0.21:         version 0.21.0,         release-0-21-fixes branch svn 16483.
    MythTV trunk:        version trunk.16487,    trunk svn 16487.

Changed Xorg and Mesa:
    - Reverted from Mesa 7.0.3-rc2 to Mesa 7.0.1 because newer versions
      cause segfaults when using MythTV on VIA video hardware due to GL/GLX
      problems.
    - Reverted from Xorg 7.3 to Xorg 7.2 because a combination of
      Xorg 7.3 and Mesa causes fequent segfaults when using xscreensaver's
      glsideshow hack with VIA video hardware.
    - Stopped including unichrome_dri.so because it is buggy (due to the fact
      that it is no longer maintained) and causes infrequent segfaults when
      using xscreensaver's glslideshow hack. Unfortunately, this means that
      there is no longer GL/GLX acceleration for VIA video hardware.

Made bug fixes
    - Fixed bug that prevented MM_DHCP_* variables in minimyth.conf from
      working. The MM_DCHP_* variables still worked when used on the boot line.
    - Fixed bug that prevented powernowd from starting when 
      MM_CPU_FREQUENCY_GOVERNOR was set to 'userspace'.

Made bug fixes in build system
    - Fixed bug that prevented perl modules from building when the native and
      cross environments are the same architecture family (i.e. both i386 or
      both x86_64).

Changes since 38 (2008-02-26):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV softpad20: version 0.20.2,   release-0-20-fixes branch svn 15874,
                                        ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07, and
                                        softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV stable20:  version 0.20.2,   release-0-20-fixes branch svn 15874, and
                                        ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV stable21:  version 0.21.0,   release-0-21-fixes branch svn 15948.
    MythTV svn:       version svn16133, trunk svn 16133.

Added MythTV 0.21 support to the build system
    - Does not work because the MythTV 0.21 tarballs have not been released.

Added perl
    - The good
        - It eliminates the need for remote perl execution.
        - It supports more perl scripts than remote perl execution.
    - The bad
        - It increases the root file system size significantly (~5MB).
            - Currently the perl files known to be unused have been removed and
              remaining the perl files have been stripped (it was ~9MB without
              this). Unfortunately, there is no way to do foolproof dependency
              tracking for perl script and modules. As a result, it is likely
              that unused perl files still remain.
    - Only tested with MythTV 0.20.
        - MythWeather 0.21 and MythWeather SVN may not work.
    - Removed remote command or ssh since it was used only to run perl
      scripts.
        - Obsoleted MM_SSH_REMOTE_* variables.

Patched MythTV
    - Patched MythTV so that mythfrontend runs a network control (aka telnet
      socket) interface on the loopback address on the port one greater than
      the configured network control port. This allows MiniMyth to use the
      network control interface without requiring the regular network control
      interface to be enabled and without interfering with the regular network
      control interface.

Updated Xorg
    - Switched to using Xorg 7.3 by default.

Updated LIRC
    - The lirc_imon module parameter islcd renamed is_lcd because the patch that
      adds LCD support to the lirc_imon has been merged upstream and uses this
      different module parameter name.

Improved build system
    - Added bluetooth kernel modules.
    - Added BlueZ libraries (lib/bluez-libs) and utilities (utils/bluez-utils).
    - Added Wii remote control (aka wiimote) libraries (lib/libwiimote) and
      utilities (utils/cwiid).
    - Added Wii remote control support.
        - It is not compiled in by default.
    - Switched to using the build system's perl.
    - Added perl packages needed to run perl dependent MythTV plugins.

                                        softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV svn:       version svn15481, trunk svn 15481.

Modified XvMC support
    - Changed /etc/X11/XvMCConfig so that it uses libXVMCNVIDIA rather
      than libXVMCNVIDIA_dynamic.
    - Changed /etc/X11/XvMCConfig so that it contains the full path.

Modified minimyth.conf
    - Added the function mm_minimyth_conf_include for fetching and including
      a file in minimyth.conf. See the example minimyth.conf for usage.
    - Obsoleted MM_CPUFREQ_GOVERNOR, replacing it with MM_CPU_FREQUENCY_GOVERNOR.
    - Added MM_CPU_FETCH_MICROCODE_DAT.

    - Added missing headers to packages
        emulaters/mednafen,
        emulaters/stella,
        emulaters/zsnes,
        lib/flac,

    - Fixed incompatible #defines in packages
        lib/libjpeg,
        myth-softpad20/mythplugins and
        myth-stable20/mythplugins,
    - Disabled fpic for i386 so that registers do not run out in packages
        mediaplayers/xine-lib.
    - Patched GCC so that it is configured correctly for glibc during cross
      compile, enabling Qt to cross compile.
    - Compiling MiniMyth with GCC 4.3 takes much longer than compiling
      MiniMyth with GCC 4.2 (8 hours versus 5 hours), so I am not sure that it
      is worth using.

Fixed file transfer problems.
    - Reincluded tftp and wget.
        - The TFTP support in curl appears to be somewhat broken.
        - The mm_local_* scripts use tftp and wget.

Modified build system.
    - Switched pbg-config to using PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR and
      PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR in order to simplify *.pc file handling
      in the cross environment.
