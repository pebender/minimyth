          <div class="heading">Why can I play some DVDs but not other DVDs?</div>
          <p>
            There are at least two possible reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first reason is that some DVDs are encrypted using CSS.
            In order to play these DVDs, you need libdvdcss.so.2.
            Because of legal issues surrounding other software that allows Linux users to play their legally purchased DVDs,
            libdvdcss.so.2 is not included in the binary MiniMyth distribution.
            Although libdvdcss.so.2 is very different from this other software, legal concerns still exist.
            Because, libdvdcss.so.2 only depends on Linux and glibc,
            you should be able to use any libdvdcss.so.2 that has been compiled for i386, i486 or i586.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have a copy of libdvdcss.so.2,
            you can add it to your MiniMyth frontend at boot by including it in your extras file system
            (see the
            <a href="document-minimyth_conf.shtml#MM_EXTRAS_URL">MM_EXTRAS_URL</a>
            variable in the MiniMyth configuration file).
            If you compile MiniMyth yourself,
            then the extras file system image that the build system creates contains libdvdcss.so.2.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second reason is that some DVD drives require their region code to be set.
            You can set your DVD drive's region code using the 'regionset' utility that is included in MiniMyth.
            For information on how to use 'regionset', see the
            <a href="http://linvdr.org/download/regionset/README">regionset readme</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="plugin-crippled" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why is my favorite Myth plugin crippled it MiniMyth?</div>
          <p>
            There are two reasons that some Myth plugins are crippled in MiniMyth:
            the plugin is broken, and
            the feature of the plugin depends on software not included in MiniMyth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some functionality of Myth plugins included in MiniMyth is crippled because the plugin is broken.
            The following plugins are known to be crippled because they are broken:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/MythWeather">MythWeather</a> 0.20.x.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some functionality of Myth plugins included in MiniMyth is missing due to the nature of MiniMyth.
          </p>
          <p>
            MiniMyth is a small distribution.
            To keep MiniMyth a small distribution, certain large packages such as
            <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>
            are not included in MiniMyth.
            As a result, Myth plugin functionality that depends on these packages does not work.
            However, MiniMyth does support
            <a href="document-minimyth_conf.shtml#MM_SSH_REMOTE">SSH remote command execution</a>,
            which can be used to work around this problem in some instances.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following plugins are known to be crippled because they depend on Perl:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~moongies/streamtuned.html">MythStream</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/MythVideo">MythVideo</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In both cases, SSH remote command execution should work around this problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time for a rant.
            I like Perl.
            I use it for many things.
            However, why would someone make Myth plugin functionality depend on Perl?
            After spending the effort to write most of the Myth plugin in C/C++,
            they make some small part of the Myth plugin depend on Perl.
            Since the functions provided by Perl (e.g. regular expression parsing, XML document parsing, HTTP protocol support)
            are available in small shared libraries,
            there is no reason to make a small Myth plugin
            depend on the large Perl and Perl modules.

        <div id="plugin-missing" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why is my favorite Myth plugin missing from MiniMyth?</div>
          <p>
            There are two reasons that some Myth plugins are not included in MiniMyth:
            the plugin has not been requested, and
            the plugin depends on software that is not included.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following plugins have not been included because they depend on software not included in MiniMyth:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/MythArchive">MythArchive</a>
              is not included because it depends on
              <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="sensor" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why are my temperature and fan sensors missing or wrong?</div>
          <p>
            You may notice that you get no output from your temperature and fan sensors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for this is that the sensor chip's kernel module is not loading.
            Unfortunately there is no simple detection method for sensor chips.
            In order to "auto-detect" the sensor chip, MiniMyth goes through a two step process.
            First, MiniMyth attempts to detect the motherboard vendor and product.
            Second, MiniMyth maps the motherboard vendor and product to sensor chip's kernel module.
            It is likely that this is not working for your motherboard,
            because MiniMyth does not have the necessary information.
            If you
            <a href="http://linpvr.org/bugs/">file a bug report</a>
            that contains the motherboard vendor and product, the output of the command 
            'cat&nbsp;/sys/class/dmi/id/modalias'
            and (if you know it) the sensor chip kernel module,
            then we can add the necessary information to MiniMyth.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may notice that either a sensor reports a temperature that is very wrong
            or a label next to a temperature or fan sensor is wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for very wrong temperature readings on VIA EPIA motherboards is
            either the specific temperature sensors are not used by the motherboard
            or there is something wrong with the vt1211 sensors driver.
            I do not know which it is.
            However, it is safe to assume that the motherboard is not at a temperature that is below freezing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for the wrong labels is that the motherboard vendor did not wire the sensors as suggested by the sensor chip vendor.
            As a result, while the values are correct, they are attributed to the wrong temperature or fan sensors on the motherboard.
            At some point, we may add motherboard specific sensors configuration files to address this problem.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="MM_DEBUG" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why doesn't MM_DEBUG work?</div>
          <p>
            People tend to have one of two problems when trying to enable debugging.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, they set MM_DEBUG in the wrong place.
            As mentioned in the
            <a href="document-configure.shtml#bootline">configuration obtained from the boot line</a>
            section, MM_DEBUG="yes" must be set on the boot line.
            If it is set in the MiniMyth configuration file, then it will be ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, they quote the MM_DEBUG variable value incorrectly.
            As mentioned in the
            <a href="document-configure.shtml#bootline">configuration obtained from the boot line</a>
            section, unlike MiniMyth variable values in the MiniMyth configuration file which should be single quoted ('),
            MiniMyth variable values on the boot line must be either unquoted or double quoted (").
            Single quoted variable values such as MM_DEBUG='yes' will not work correctly.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="build" class="section">
          <div class="heading">How can I build MiniMyth from source?</div>
          <p>
            The answer to this question can be found on the
            <a href="document-build.shtml">MiniMyth build system instructions page</a>.

        <div id="bug" class="section">
          <div class="heading">How do I report a bug or request a feature?</div>
          <p>
            The best way to report a bug or request a feature is to submit it to the
            <a href="http://linpvr.org/bugs/">bug tracking system</a>.
