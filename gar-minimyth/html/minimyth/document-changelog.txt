Changes since 60 (2008-11-28):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 0.20-softpad: version 0.20.2.softpad, release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082,
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07, and
                                                 softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV 0.20:         version 0.20.2,         release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082, and
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV 0.21:         version 0.21.0,         release-0-21-fixes branch svn 19162
    MythTV trunk:        version trunk.19168    trunk svn 19169

Modified kernel
    - Disabled use of out-of-tree ALSA 1.0.18a drivers as some of the drivers
      fail after suspend-to-RAM.
    - Reverted to kernel 2.6.26 bacause wake-on-USB doe now work under kernel
      2.6.27.
    - Added patch that may help pervent NFS failures after suspend-to-RAM.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Added VDPAU support to FFmpeg and MPlayer SVN.
        - VDPAU NVIDIA drivers are not included in the binary image.
    - Made sure players are not using libFLAC because FFmpeg's FLAC decoder
      should work.
    - Made sure players are using libFAAD because FFmpeg's AAC decoder lacks
      certain capabilities.
    - Made sure that all are using the shared libdca rather than their
      internal versions of libdca/libdts.
    - Renamed mplayer-stable to mplayer-vld in order to reflect that the only
      reason it continues to be included is because it supports XvMC-VLD.

Modified init
    - Modified init so that it redirects the output of '/usr/sbin/powernowd'
      to /dev/null.
    - Modified init so that it links mplayer appropriate version (mplayer-svn or
      mplayer-vld), which depends on whether or not the MiniMyth is using
      XvMC-VLD for MPEG2 decoding.

Fixed bugs
    - Worked around problem in Sys::Hostname::hostname that caused the perl init
      script to fail when the host name was set using MM_DHCP_HOST_NAME. It
      appears that there is at least one bug in Sys::Hostname::hostname that
      causes the value to be incorrect when the host name is changed after
      Sys::Hostname is loaded.
    - Fixed bug that caused perl init scripts to create '/STDOUT' rather than
      '/var/log/minimyth.log'.
    - Fixed bug that caused MM_MYTHDB_SETTINGS_* variables to fail when using
      perl init scripts.
    - Fixed bug in MiniMyth::mythdb_jumppoints_update.
    - Fixed bug in MiniMyth::mythdb_x_get. This bug could cause the perl init
      scripts to fail with the error message 'configuring video ...'.
    - Fixed bug in the openChrome driver's XvMC-VLD implementation:
      <http://wiki.openchrome.org/pipermail/openchrome-devel/2008-November/000140.html>

Modified build system
    - Changed mksquashfs so that it uses more conservative settings. I hope
      that this will reduce the chance of creating bad squashfs images.
    - Removed FFmpeg's dependency on SDL.
    - Removed giflib's dependency on X11.
    - Removed xine-lib's dependency on FLAC.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed bug that caused MythTV trunk to pick up files from the build
      system.
    - Fixed bug that caused there to be no shared library for bzip2.

          minimyth.conf file.
        - As with the radeon driver, you will likely need to create a custom
          xorg.conf file.
    - Patched the radeonhd driver with the HDMI-including-audio patch.

        - This was done to enable MiniMyth to save more than one cached theme
          in the file as it is supported by MythTV 0.21.

Modified MiniMyth commands
    - Changed mm_sleep so that is saves the system clock to the hardware
      clock on suspend and sets the system clock to the hardware clock on
      wakeup.
    - Changed mm_sleep so that it restarts commands that it stops using the
      original command line not the default command line.
    - Changed mm_sleep_on_ss so that it daemonizes.

Changes since 57 (2008-09-10):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 0.21:  version 0.21.0,      release-0-21-fixes branch svn 18228.
    MythTV trunk: version trunk.18227, trunk svn 18227.

Converted to perl from sh
    - Added MiniMyth perl package.
        - Implements the functions in /etc/rc.d/functions.
            - 'mm_*' maps to 'MiniMyth::*' execpt for 'mm_mythdb_*_dump'
                which maps to 'MiniMyth::mythdb_*_print'
            - Function arguments differ because perl supports types other than
              strings.
            - Function return mechanism differs because perl support
              non-integer return values.
    - Added perl init scripts.
        - sh init scripts are the default.
        - perl init scripts can be enabled by adding MM_INIT_TYPE=perl to the
          boot line.
    - Converted the following mm_* scripts to perl:
        mm_command
        mm_external
        mm_game_exit
        mm_game_start
        mm_sleep
        mm_sleep_on_ss
        mm_ss_suspend
        mm_term_exit
        mm_term_start
    - Converted web page CGI scripts to perl.

Modified image
    - Added g15daemon's g15plugin_clock to help with testing.

Modified init
    - Changed udev rules so that they move /dev/uinput to /dev/input/uinput.
    - Added file '/init.log' that contains the init start and end times,
      allowing timing of sh and perl based init scripts.

Modified Linux kernel
    - Updated squashfs to 3.4.

Fixed bugs
    - Changed init so that it creates an empty /etc/g15daemon.conf when
      init determines it needs to run g15daemon and /etc/g15daemon.conf does
      not exist.
    - Added g15daemon's g15plugin_tcpserver because it appears to be needed
      even when the client and server are on the same computer.
    - Patched the Xorg Intel driver with the patch from ticket 16833:
      <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16833> and
      <http://people.freedesktop.org/~jcristau/i830_dsparb_sooner.diff>
    - Fixed typo that caused MiniMyth to not fetch xmodmaprc when present in
      the MiniMyth read-only configuration directory.
    - Fixed variable name error that caused the MM_X_FETCH_XORG_CONF variable
      to not be checked (though it was still used).
    - Fixed typo that caused MiniMyth to reject the 576 television resolution
      when using the openchrome driver.
    - Fixed typo that caused MiniMyth shutdown to not cleanly stop the splash

    - ALSA drivers should already support the speakers.

Improved Xorg keyboard handling
    - Added MM_X_FETCH_XMODMAPRC for fetching the xmodmaprc file.

      and auto deinterlacer values to be rejected.
    - Blacklisted the 8250, 8250_pci and 8250_pnp kernel drivers so that they
      are not loaded by udev.
    - Added KERNEL=="hiddev[0-9]*",SUBSYSTEM=="usb" to the lirc udev rule so
      that the USB DViCO remote can be detected.
    - Converted more of the DViCO remote keys to the LIRC namespace, but there
      are still keys that have not been converted.
    - Added missing imonlcd configuration to the LCDd.conf file.
    - Fixed permission problems with MythTV's config.xml and mysql.txt files
      by giving user 'minimyth' (who runs the mythfrontend and mythwelcome)
      and the user 'root' (who runs mythbackend) separate copies.

Modified build system

Changes since 55 (2008-07-06):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 0.21:  version 0.21.0,      release-0-21-fixes branch svn 17722.
    MythTV trunk: version trunk.17721, trunk svn 17721.

Added MythTV backend support
    - Added backend init script.
    - Added MM_BACKEND init conf script.
    - Added backend detection based on DVB card being present.

Added DVB support
    - Enabled DVB support in MythTV.
    - Added DVB card support to the udev rules.
    - Enabled the DVB card support in the kernel needed to support the modules
      listed here: <http://minimyth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1804>.

Modified init
    - Added MM_MEDIA_TV_MOUNTPOINT and MM_MEDIA_TV_URL.
    - Updated the values for the MM_VIDEO_DEINTERLACER variable so that they
      match MythTV 0.21 rather than MythTV 0.20.
    - Changed init so that it creates MythTV's config.xml file.
    - Changed init so that it adds LocalHostName to MythTV's mysql.txt file.
    - Moved MythTV's config.xml and mysql.txt file to /etc/mythtv.
    - Added additional checks when mounting the media (MM_MEDIA) shares.
        - Check that the mount exists after mounting.
        - Check that the mount is readable (and writable when needed) by the
          user 'minimyth'.
    - Stopped setting UseChromaKeyOSD in database settings table since it is
      not used in MythTV 0.21 or newer.
    - Disabled MythTV's use of OpenGL vertical sync when the intel Xorg driver
      is used because it does not work

Modified image
    - Switched to the out-of-tree ALSA drivers because they fix a VLC audio
      problem (no audio) on the ASUS A8N-VM CSM.
    - Switched from Busybox's top to procps' top because it is more flexible.
    - Switched from Busybox's ps to procps' ps because MythTV makes system
      calls to ps that fail with Busybox's ps.
    - Added lsof and pmap to the normal image.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed typo in /etc/rc.d/functions.
        - Changed mm_sleep_on_xss to mm_sleep_on_ss.
    - Added trap to the mm_ss_suspend script that kills child processes when
      the mm_ss_suspend script is killed.
    - Added trap to the mm_sleep_on_ss script that kills child processes when
      the mm_sleep_on_ss script is killed.
    - Changed mm_sleep so that it disables and reenables mm_sleep_on_ss when
      mm_sleep_on_ss is running.
    - Switched from Busybox's ps to procps' ps, because MythTV makes system
      calls to ps and expects certain textual output. While such system calls
      should be avoided, the easiest way to deal with it is to provide MythTV
      with the ps that it expects.
    - Fixed problem with VLC playback of flash file playback.
        - Enabled sout (streaming output).

Modified build system
    - Changed how the libtool fix-ups are done.
        - Created the macro FIX_LIBTOOL_HARDCODE that fixes the library path
          hardcoding.
        - Created the macro FIX_LIBTOOL_LIBPATH that fixes the library link
          and run search paths.
        - Created the macro FIX_LIBTOOL that is the combination of the macros
          FIX_LIBTOOL_HARDCODE and FIX_LIBTOOL_LIBPATH.
        - Stopped running autoreconf to fix library link search path since the
          FIX_LIBTOOL_LIBPATH macro should fix it.
            - Packages that patch their autoconf files for other reasons
              continue to run autoreconf.
        - Stopped using custom sed lines to fix library path hard coding since
          the FIX_LIBTOOL_HARCODE macro should fix it.
    - Enabled DVB support in MythTV, making it somewhat easier for those
      building MiniMyth based slave backends that use DVB cards.
    - Enabled the DVB card support in the kernel needed to support the modules
      list here: <http://minimyth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1804>.
    - Added mm_SOFTWARE variable value 'backend' for including MythTV backend
      in the binary image.
    - Changed build system so that it creates symbolic links to config.xml and
      mysql.txt in the /home/minimyth/.mythtv directory.
    - Reverted to GCC 4.3.1 to 4.3.0 because there are some compiler
      optimization compilation problems with MythTV using GCC 4.3.1. Even
      though MythTV has a workaround, it is possible that other packages have
      problems with GCC 4.3.1 as well.
    - Changed binutils, gcc and make packages so that they do not apply their
      repsective perl patches when doing a native build.
    - Changed build system so that it copies /root from the dirs directory
      rather than creating it. This makes it easier to add program
      configuration files used by the user root.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed bug that caused libtool to search the wrong library directories,
      sometimes resulting in compilation failure:
          lib/taglib

Changes since 54 (2008-06-15):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 0.21:  version 0.21.0,      release-0-21-fixes branch svn 17450.
    MythTV trunk: version trunk.17452, trunk svn 17452.

Modified media players
    - Added SVN version of MPlayer (the binary is called mplayer-svn) and
      changed it so that it uses the shared FFmpeg library.
    - Changed the Xine library so that it uses the shared FFmpeg library.
    - Updated the shared FFmpeg library.
    - Updated the Xine library.
    - With these changes, MPlayer SVN, VLC and Xine use the same shared FFmpeg
      library.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed bug with using DPMS and the NVIDIA driver.
        - Changed default NVIDIA driver version from 173.14.05 to 169.12,
          since 173.14.05 has the problem and 169.12 does not.
    - Fixed but that caused mm_x_stop function to fail.
        - Changed mm_x_applications_list function so that it cleans up
          whitespace that was confusing the other mm_x_applications_*
          functions.
    - Fixed ASUS M2N-VM DVI audio.
        - Added appropriate module option using a modalias.
    - Fixed e1000e Ethernet driver.
        - Patched the 2.6.23 kernel to include the e1000e Ethernet driver.

Modified build system 
    - Added check to make sure build_GARCH_FAMILY is valid.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed bug that caused pkg-config to find the wrong *.pc files when the
      the user's environment sets PKG_CONFIG_PATH.
        - The build system sets PKG_CONFIG_PATH='' now.
    - Fixed bug in package utils/util-linux-ng that caused its configure
      script to find the wrong vol_id binary.
        - The Makefile file adds $(build_DESTDIR)$(build_elibdir)/udev to the
          path now.
    - Fixed bug that caused build_GARCH_FAMILY to be set incorrectly.
        - Apparently, the output of 'uname -i' is not the same for all Linux
          distributions. Therefore, the value of build_GARCH is used, which is
          based on the output of 'uname -m'.
    - Fixed bug where the compiler would sometimes find the system's libraries
      rather than the MiniMyth compiled native libraries for some packages
      (e.g. system/udev).
        - Patched binutils and gcc so that they use lib not lib64 for x86_64
          libraries.
        - Added LIBRARY_PATH to the build system so that the native compiler
          knows about all the library directories and searches them in the
          correct order.
    - Fixed bug that caused libtool to search the wrong library directories,
      sometimes resulting in compilation failure:
          lib/bluez-libs
          lib/dbus
          lib/libart
          lib/libftdi
          lib/libxml2
          lib/libxslt
          utils/bluez-utils
          xorg-7.3/libXfont
          xorg-7.3/libXinerama
     - Fixed a bug in fetching files from SVN that could cause download
       problems with files such as the net/mount.cifs package files.

Enhanced MiniMyth
    - Added support for ext3 and ntfs (read only) file systems.

Modified MiniMyth mm_* functions
    - Restructured the code that shuts down X applications and returns
      mythfrontend to the main menu, allowing it to be used by functions other
      than the mm_suspend script.

    MythTV trunk:        version trunk.16747,    trunk svn 16747.

Changed Xorg and Mesa
    - Patched Mesa with <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13541>
      in order to fix some GL/GLX related crashes.
    - Re-included unichrome_dri.so since the Mesa patch appears to have fixed
      the UI crases and video renderer fallback to OpenGL has already by
      patched.
    - Switched back to Xorg 7.3 in order to overcome a crash when using the
      program guide on at least some VIA hardware.

Improved build system
    - Added initial support for Qt 4 that will soon be required by MythTV trunk.
        - While the build system supports both Qt 3 and Qt 4, you cannot have
          both Qt 3 and Qt 4 in the same build.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed bug that caused MiniMyth's playback profile to fail for xvmc-vld.
    - Fixed bug that prevented local boot.
    - Overcame bug that caused the program guide to crash on at least some
      VIA hardware.
    - Fixed bug that caused lm_sensors to incorrectly handle virtual devices
      by appling the patch dated 2008-03-17 found at
      <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=437637>.

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 0.20-softpad: version 0.20.2.softpad, release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082,
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07, and
                                                 softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV 0.20:         version 0.20.2,         release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082, and
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV 0.21:         version 0.21.0,         release-0-21-fixes branch svn 16577.
    MythTV trunk:        version trunk.16588,    trunk svn 16588.

Improved init
    - Changed init to create video playback profile name 'MiniMyth' for MythTV
      0.21 and trunk based on MiniMyth configuration variables.
    - Added MM_VIDEO_PLAYBACK_PROFILE for configuring the video playback profile
      in MythTV 0.21 and trunk.

Enhanced MPlayer
    - Added DVD navigation support. When MythTV's internal player does not play
      a DVD or DVD ISO correctly, I use the following MPlayer commands instead:
        - For a DVD
          mplayer -fs -quiet -nocache -vfm ffmpeg -vo xv dvdnav://0 -dvd-device /dev/dvd
        - For a DVD ISO
          mplayer -fs -quiet -nocache -vfm ffmpeg -vo xv dvdnav://0 -dvd-device %s
    - Changed LIRC KEY_UP, KEY_DOWN, KEY_LEFT, KEY_RIGHT, KEY_OK and KEY_DVD
      so that they control DVD navigation functionality.
    - It crashes when either XvMC or XvMC-VLD is enabled. I have no looked
      into the cause.
    - If you are using Xine for DVD playback and you do not require XvMC or
      XvMC-VLD support, then please try using mplayer instead. As some point
      in the future, I would like to remove Xine.

Removed packages
    Removed lib/libdvdread (included in lib/libdvdnav).

Added packages
    Added lib/libdvdnav.

Updated packages
    Updated disk/e2fsprogs.
    Updated devel/binutils.
    Updated kernel-2.6.23/uvc.
    Updated kernel-2.6.24/uvc.
    Updated lib/libcdio.

Changes since 41 (2008-03-12):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 0.20-softpad: version 0.20.2.softpad, release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082,
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07, and
                                                 softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV 0.20:         version 0.20.2,         release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082, and
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV 0.21:         version 0.21.0,         release-0-21-fixes branch svn 16483.
    MythTV trunk:        version trunk.16487,    trunk svn 16487.

Changed Xorg and Mesa:
    - Reverted from Mesa 7.0.3-rc2 to Mesa 7.0.1 because newer versions
      cause segfaults when using MythTV on VIA video hardware due to GL/GLX
      problems.
    - Reverted from Xorg 7.3 to Xorg 7.2 because a combination of
      Xorg 7.3 and Mesa causes fequent segfaults when using xscreensaver's
      glsideshow hack with VIA video hardware.
    - Stopped including unichrome_dri.so because it is buggy (due to the fact
      that it is no longer maintained) and causes infrequent segfaults when
      using xscreensaver's glslideshow hack. Unfortunately, this means that
      there is no longer GL/GLX acceleration for VIA video hardware.

Made bug fixes
    - Fixed bug that prevented MM_DHCP_* variables in minimyth.conf from
      working. The MM_DCHP_* variables still worked when used on the boot line.
    - Fixed bug that prevented powernowd from starting when 
      MM_CPU_FREQUENCY_GOVERNOR was set to 'userspace'.

Made bug fixes in build system
    - Fixed bug that prevented perl modules from building when the native and
      cross environments are the same architecture family (i.e. both i386 or
      both x86_64).

      distribution, a file that contains boot loaders and configuration filess
      for PXELINUX and gPXE.

Changes since 38 (2008-02-26):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV softpad20: version 0.20.2,   release-0-20-fixes branch svn 15874,
                                        ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07, and
                                        softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV stable20:  version 0.20.2,   release-0-20-fixes branch svn 15874, and
                                        ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV stable21:  version 0.21.0,   release-0-21-fixes branch svn 15948.
    MythTV svn:       version svn16133, trunk svn 16133.

Added MythTV 0.21 support to the build system
    - Does not work because the MythTV 0.21 tarballs have not been released.

Added perl
    - The good
        - It eliminates the need for remote perl execution.
        - It supports more perl scripts than remote perl execution.
    - The bad
        - It increases the root file system size significantly (~5MB).
            - Currently the perl files known to be unused have been removed and
              remaining the perl files have been stripped (it was ~9MB without
              this). Unfortunately, there is no way to do foolproof dependency
              tracking for perl script and modules. As a result, it is likely
              that unused perl files still remain.
    - Only tested with MythTV 0.20.
        - MythWeather 0.21 and MythWeather SVN may not work.
    - Removed remote command or ssh since it was used only to run perl
      scripts.
        - Obsoleted MM_SSH_REMOTE_* variables.

Patched MythTV
    - Patched MythTV so that mythfrontend runs a network control (aka telnet
      socket) interface on the loopback address on the port one greater than
      the configured network control port. This allows MiniMyth to use the
      network control interface without requiring the reqular network control
      interface to be enabled and without interfering with the regular network
      control interface.

Updated Xorg
    - Switched to using Xorg 7.3 by default.

Updated LIRC
    - The lirc_imon module parameter islcd renamed is_lcd because the patch that
      adds LCD support to the lirc_imon has been merged upstream and uses this
      different module parameter name.

Improved build system
    - Added bluetooth kernel modules.
    - Added BlueZ libraries (lib/bluez-libs) and utilities (utils/bluez-utils).
    - Added Wii remote control (aka wiimote) libraries (lib/libwiimote) and
      utilities (utils/cwiid).
    - Added Wii remote control support.
        - It is not compiled in by default.
    - Switched to using the build system's perl.
    - Added perl packages needed to run perl dependent MythTV plugins.

    - Changed /etc/X11/XvMCConfig so that it contains the full path.

Modified minimyth.conf
    - Added the function mm_minimyth_conf_include for fetching and including
      a file in minimyth.conf. See the example minimyth.conf for usage.
    - Obsoleted MM_CPUFREQ_GOVERNOR, replacing it with MM_CPU_FREQUENCY_GOVERNOR.
    - Added MM_CPU_FETCH_MICROCODE_DAT.

    - Added missing headers to packages
        emulaters/mednafen,

        emulaters/zsnes,
        lib/flac,
        lib/libcdio,

    - Fixed incompatible #defines in packages
        lib/libjpeg,
        myth-softpad20/mythplugins and
        myth-stable20/mythplugins,
    - Disabled fpic for i386 so that registers do not run out in packages
        mediaplayers/xine-lib.
    - Patched GCC so that it is configured correctly for glibc during cross
      compile, enabling Qt to cross compile.
    - Compiling MiniMyth with GCC 4.3 takes much longer than compiling
      MiniMyth with GCC 4.2 (8 hours versus 5 hours), so I am not sure that it
      is worth using.

Fixed file transfer problems.
    - Reincluded tftp and wget.
        - The TFTP support in curl appears to be somewhat broken.
        - The mm_local_* scripts use tftp and wget.

    MythTV svn:       version svn15142, trunk svn 15142.

Fixed DHCP override
    - MM_DHCP_* override variables were being ignored. ARG!!!

Improved LIRC support
    - Added patch to support the 'include' statement in 'lircd.conf'.
    - Changed to using a single generated 'lircd.conf' similar to the single.
      generated 'lircrc'.

Began adding gcc 4.3 support
    - Added linker patch for gcc 4.3.
    - Added gcc 4.3 patch to 'devel/glibc' to add gcc's new include-fixed
      system include directory.
    - Added -fgnu89-inline compiler flag to packages
        utils/coreutils,
        utils/m4 and
        utils/tar.
      in order to work aroud glibc wchar.h header file bug.
    - Removed unneeded 'kernel/kernel' dependency from
        lib/alsa-lib,
        myth-stable20/mythtv,
        myth-softpad20/mythtv and
        myth-svn/mythtv.
    - Fails to build the Linux kernel. See
        <http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32044> and
        <http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8501>.
    - It may fail to build other packages as well, since several packages are
      blocked by the Linux kernel build failure.

Updated packages

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 34 (2007-12-28):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV stable20:  version 0.20.2,   release-0-20-fixes branch svn 15087, and
                                        ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV softpad20: version 0.20.2,   release-0-20-fixes branch svn 15087,
                                        ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07, and
                                        softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV svn:       version svn15142, trunk svn 15142.

Changed DHCP support
    - Switched from dhclient to udhcpc.
        - Could not make it request the address obtained during NFS boot.
        - Found bugs in dhclient that could cause memory corruption.
        - Unfortunately we no longer have vendor specific attributes so we
          no longer have minimyth.boot-url.
    - Obsoleted MM_DHCP_MINIMYTH_BOOT_URL
        - Replaced with MM_MINIMYTH_BOOT_URL.
    - Changed /etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcp so that it always restarts the udhcpc, even
      when /etc/udhcpc.conf has not changed, resulting in more predictable
      behavior.

Changed kernel configuration
    - Enabled HPET (high precision event timer) support.
    - Switched to timer frequecy to 1000Hz (from 250Hz).
        - 1000Hz is more widely used so it is likely to have fewer problems.
    - Switched to a tickless system.
        - Can help with power consumption.
    - Switched to ATA (from IDE) for all supported hardware.
        - The PATA ATI and PATA SiS drivers are still experimental.
        - Removed the longhaul_ide_lockup patch since it depends on IDE.
          Hopefully, it is no longer needed.
    - Disabled some legacy APIs, legacy procfs entries and legacy sysfs
      entries, none of which should be needed any longer.
    - Removed the via_rhine_pxeboot patch since it is handled by the driver,
      using BIOS information made availabe using the DMI interface.

Removed packages
    Removed net/dhcp.

Updated packages
    Updated kernel-2.6.23/gspca.
    Updated kernel-2.6.24/gspca.

    MythTV svn:       version svn15142, trunk svn 15142.

ALERT
    - Please replace your boot line parameter 'ramdisk=' with 'ramdisk_size='.
      The boot parameter 'ramdisk' has been deprecated for some time. Starting
      with the 2.6.24 kernel it has become obsolete. Therefore, as of the 2.6.24
      kernel it will no longer work.

Changed NVIDIA driver
    - Made NVIDIA driver 169.07 the default.

Improved support for multiple network interfaces
    - Use first connected network interface rather than eth0.

Changes since 32 (2007-12-19):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV stable20:  version 0.20.2,   release-0-20-fixes branch svn 15087, and
                                        ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV softpad20: version 0.20.2,   release-0-20-fixes branch svn 15087,
                                        ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07, and
                                        softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV svn:       version svn15142, trunk svn 15142.

Improved security implementation.
    - Disabled telnet server until after minimyth.conf is processed.
    - Enabled virtual terminal and telnet server when error is detected during
      boot (i.e. init), making debugging easier but security weaker.
    - Added MM_SECURITY_ENABLED and obsoleted MM_SECURITY_LEVEL.
    - Added MM_SECURITY_USER_MINIMYTH_UID and MM_SECURITY_USER_MINIMYTH_GID 
      for setting the UID and GID used by the user 'minimyth', making it
      easier to interoperate more securely with NFS shares.
    - Added MM_SECURITY_FETCH_CREDENTIALS_CIFS for fetch a CIFS credentials
      file that can be used by mount.cifs when connecting to CIFS shares.
    - Disabled password access for users 'root' and 'minimyth' when security
      is enabled and not debugging.
    - Stopped looking for most configuration files in the MiniMyth read-write
      configuration directory.
    - Obsoleted the MM_REMOTE_FETCH_ID_RSA variable since it is redundant.
    - Obsoleted the MM_SERVER_FETCH_SSH_HOST_RSA_KEY and
      MM_SSH_SERVER_FETCH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS variables since they are redundant.

Improved file transfer.
    - Added curl.
    - Removed tftp and wget since curl supports FTP, HTTP, and TFTP.
    - Added DHCP option (minimyth.boot-url) for setting the boot directory
      location used to locate configuration and distribution files. This allows
      the user to download/upload of configuration and distributions files using
      a protocol other than the slow and unreliable TFTP.
    - Obsoleted boot line variables MM_BOOT_TYPE (and MM_BOOT_TYPE) since they
      have been replaced by the minimyth.boot-url DHCP option.

Improved DHCP options.
    - Added support for vendor specific information options.
        - Switched from udhcpc to dhclient.
        - Added vendor minimyth.
        - Added vendor option minimyth.boot-url.
    - Consolidated DHCP override variables.
        - Eliminated the duplicate DHCP override variables that do not start
          with MM_DHCP_.
    - Renamed DHCP override variables to better match the DHCP option names
        - MM_DHCP_HOSTNAME -> MM_DHCP_HOST_NAME.
        - MM_DHCP_DOMAIN -> MM_DHCP_DOMAIN_NAME.
        - MM_DHCP_DNS_SERVERS -> MM_DHCP_DOMAIN_NAME_SERVERS.
        - MM_DHCP_TZ -> MM_DHCP_TCODE.
    - Removed MM_NTP_FAILURE_ACTION.
        - MiniMyth now continues on NTP failure.

Fixed MythWeather.
    - Applied patch from Ubuntu.

Changed ALSA drivers.

Added MythBrowser support
    Added MM_MYTHBROWSER_ENABLED to control whether or not MythBrowswer is used.

Added MythPhone support
    Added MM_MYTHPHONE_ENABLED to control whether or not MythPhone is used.

    Renamed removable device file system names so that they are more user
        friendly.
    Patched MythTV so that it uses the 'eject' command rather than its
        internal command when the 'eject' command is present. The 'eject'
        command works around problems that can prevent some CDs and DVDs from
        ejecting.

Added SSH remote command execution

    Changed how the LIRC daemon is run so that the 'master' LIRC daemon is used
        only when there are more than one LIRC devices.
    Moved LIRC auto-detection from udev rules/scripts to init scripts.

Modified udev
    Changed udev rules so that udev does not mount removable disks.
    Added udev rules and script  so that MythTV receives removable disk events.
    Remoted rules and script for LIRC auto-detection.

Improved the build system
    Added the ability to control the software included using the mm_SOFTWARE
        value in minimyth.conf.mk.
    Modularized MythPlugins so that they are selected and built independently.

    Added MM_CONF_VERSION to /etc/conf.d/core, which increases each time
        the minimyth.conf file format changes.

            MM_CONF_VERSION.
    Added MM_MINIMYTH_FETCH_MINIMYTH_SCRIPT, MM_X_FETCH_XINITRC,
        MM_X_FETCH_XORG_CONF, MM_LIRC_LIRCD_CONF, MM_LIRC_LIRCRC and
        MM_LCDPROC_FETCH_LCDD_CONF to indicate explicitly whether or not
        to fetch the files 'minimyth.script', 'xinitrc', 'xorg.conf',

        is done.
    Added MM_MYTHAUDIO_MOUNTPOINT and MM_MYTHAUDIO_URL.

        multiple MythTV plugins do not work correctly without it.
    Renamed MM_GAME_SAVE_ENABLE from MM_GAME_SAVE_ENABLE to
        MM_GAME_SAVE_ENABLED so that it is more consistant with other

Modified udev
    Changed the default for DMA on IDE devices to be off.
    Changed udev rules to enable DMA on IDE DVD devices.

    Added Xorg's built in screensaver.
    Changed minimyth.conf from MM_X_SCREENSAVER_ENABLED to MM_X_SCREENSAVER
        to enabled selecting been, 'none', 'xorg' and 'xscreensaver'.

Improved MythTV
    Added MythGame plugin.
        Added FCE Ultra, jzIntv, Stella, VisualBoyAdvance and ZSNES emulators.
        Added joystick Linux kernel driver (joydev).
        Added MM_MYTHGAME_ENABLED and MM_MYTHGAME_URL to minimyth.conf.
        Added mm_game_start script for starting the appropriate game
            emulator with the correct arguments.
        Added mm_game_exit script for exiting the running game emulator.
            The included lircrc files use this script to enable the remote to
            exit the running game emulator.
        Added ability to save/restore game configuration to/from the
            MiniMyth read-write configuration directory. This is enabled
            using MM_GAME_SAVE_ENABLE.
        Added MM_GAME_BIOS_ROOT and MM_GAME_GAME_ROOT for pointed to the
            directories that contain game console BIOS roms and game console
            game ROMS.
    Fixed WMA support.
        For some reason, using --disable-audio-oss in MythTV configure
            breaks WMA support. Therefore, --enable-audo-oss is being used now.
    Fixed MHEG support.
        For some reason, using -Os option in gcc 3.4.6 breaks the error handling
            in libmythfreemheg. Therefore, gcc pre 4.1.2 is being used now.
        MHEG standardized on a non-free font. An acceptable substitute is
            FreeSans. So, FreeSans as been re-included.
    Added support for the experimental plugin MythAudio - a replacement for
            MythMusic.
    Added "MiniMyth Tools" menu.

Improved Init
    Added ability for minimyth.script to insert/delete/reorder startup and
        shutdown scripts.
    Fixed problems with Intel graphics problems. However, since I do not have
        Intel graphics hardware, I am sure that there are still more problems.

Added support for NFS mounting a swap partition
    Added the utilities need to NFS mount a swap partition: losetup, mkswap,
        swapoff and swapoff.
    Added instructions for NFS mounting a swap partition to the example
        minimyth.script file.

Added VMware support
    Added kernel, alsa and xorg drivers for VMware.
    Added minimyth-lib-list.vmware for controlling the inclusion of the vmware
        in the image.

Extended minimyth.conf
    Renamed the MM_MYTHDB_* variables to match the name of the mythconverg
        table: MM_MYTHDB_JUMPPOINT -> MM_MYTHDB_JUMPPOINTS,
        MM_MYTHDB_PLAYLIST -> MM_MYTHDB_PLAYLISTS, and
        MM_MYTHDB_SETTING -> MM_MYTHDB_SETTINGS. Renamed the mm_mythdb_*
        functions accordingly.
        
Improved build system
    Fixed build problems on Fedora Core 6.
        Changed the native environment build to build a minimal gcc compiler
            before building binutils when the system's binutils are newer than
            build system's binutils. This is done because once we build
            binutils, the system's gcc may no longer work because it assumes
            a newer binutils.
        Updated package 'utils/util-linux' to a version that is compatible
            with the kernel headers in Fedora Core 6.
        Switched to using the system's chown because the chown from
            'utils/coreutils' does not work on Fedora Core 6. At some point
            this should be debugged and fixed.
        Fixed problem with building 'utils/pciutils' on some systems by
            explicitly setting the host and disabling zlib.
    Improved xorg-7.0/* package building
        Changed cross compilation patches to the patches available from
            <http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/CrossCompilingXorg>.
        Made the DEPENDS lists of several pakages more accurate.
        Alphabetized the DEPENDS and BUILDDEPS lists.
        Parameterized the package Makefiles so that packages for different
            versions of modular xorg (e.g. 7.0 and 7.2) will be more similar,
            allowing the differences between the the versions to be more
            easily seen.

Added MythTV 0.20 support

Enabled color OSD for VIA graphics
    The "hack" can be found here: <http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/XvMC>.

Improved television compatibility
    Changed boot splash screen from 800x600 to 640x480, which should work
        work with 480p capable televisions.

Improved documentation
    Converted documentation from text to XHTML 1.1.
    Added the documentation to the LinPVR.org site. It is available at
        <html://linpvr.org/minimyth/>.
    Added the documentation to the MiniMyth image. It is available through
        the MiniMyth frontend's web interface.

Cleand up the MiniMyth configuration file.
    Merged MM_X_RESOLUTION_X and MM_X_RESOLUTION_Y into MM_X_RESOLUTION.
    Removed MM_X_DISPLAYSIZE. It is now calculated automatically.
    Added MM_VIDEO_FONT_SCALE, MM_X_SYNC and MM_X_TV_OVERSCAN.

Improved auto-detection and auto-configuration
    Changed motherboard determination to use the output of 'dmidecode' rather
        than the output of 'lspci'.
    Changed MiniMyth configuration variables that can auto-configure to have
        the explicit values 'auto' and 'none' so the the user can disable
        auto-configuration.
    Made more MiniMyth configuration variables be able to auto-configure.
        MM_X_DISPLAYSIZE defaults to 'auto', setting the display size so that
            the the vertical dots per inch is 100, using MM_VIDEO_ASPECT_RATIO
            and either MM_X_RESOLUTION or MM_X_MODE.

            "dist:/themes/${MM_THEME_NAME}".
        MM_THEMEOSD_URL defaults to 'auto', setting the MythTV OSD theme URL to
            "dist:/themes/${MM_THEMEOSD_NAME}".

Improved MythStream support
    Changed builds that use MythStream 0.17_* to use MythStream 0.17_2 in
        order to pick up the exec (binary) based parser support that Eric added.
    Changed 0.19 build from MythStream 0.16_5 to MythStream 0.17_2.

Fixed network boot with NFS root file system
    Fixed a bug introduced in a previous version that caused the DHCP client
        to incorrectly reset the network interface whn the root file system is
        NFS and the DHCP client is started.

Modified GAR build system
    Renamed mm_INSTALL_TFTP_BOOT to mm_INSTALL_RAM_BOOT.
    Added mm_INSTALL_LATEST.
    Changed tarball names and contents to better match their function and make
        them more self-contained.

Changes since 17 (2006-09-05):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,   release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,     release-0-19-fixes branch svn 10505.
    MythTV SVN: version svn10992, trunk svn 10992.

Fixed shell scripts bug.
    None of the shell script variables in functions were scoped as local. It
        is amazing that any of the shell scripts worked. In fact, the mm_local_*
        shell scripts exhibited strange behavior as a result of this bug.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 16 (2006-09-03):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,   release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,     release-0-19-fixes branch svn 10505.
    MythTV SVN: version svn10992, trunk svn 10992.

Changed MiniMyth distribution packaging
    Separated MythTV themes into separate files.
        Themes are loaded at boot time from the distribution's 'themes'
            directory.
        Which MythTV theme and MythTV OSD theme are loaded are controlled by
            the required minimyth.conf variables MM_THEME_URL and
            MM_THEMEOSD_URL respectively.
    There are now two MiniMyth distribution files:
        sfs-<version>.tar.bz2 that contains squashfs based booting image files.
        tar-<version>.tar.bz2 that contains nfs based booting tarball files.
    sfs-<version> expands into a directory 'sfs-<version>' which contains:
        kernel : the Linux kernel
        rootfs : the MiniMyth root files system squashfs image
        themes : a directory of MythTV theme squashfs images.

Improved the local boot install and update scripts
    Renamed the install and update scripts to 'mm_local_install' and
       'mm_local_update' respectively.
    Added the 'mm_local_helper' file that is used by 'mm_local_install' and
       'mm_local_update'. This file enables the installation method to change
       between releases because this file is first downloaded from MiniMyth
       distribution directory and then used to install the distribution.
    Changed the default value for MM_UPDATE_URL to
       'http://linpvr.org/minimyth/download/stable/latest/' in order to match
       LinPVR.org's new directory structure.

Modified GAR build system
    Removed several attributes from 'minimyth.conf.mk'.
    Moved source tarball generation to 'meta/minimyth/minimyth.mk'.

Updated packages
    Updated mythtv/mythplugins-svn.
    Updated mythtv/myththemes-svn.
    Updated mythtv/mythtv-svn.
    Updated system/splashutils.
    Updated utils/m4.

Changes since 15 (2006-08-29):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,   release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,     release-0-19-fixes branch svn 10505.
    MythTV SVN: version svn10701, trunk svn 10701.

Changes since 14 (2006-08-29):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,   release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,     release-0-19-fixes branch svn 10505.
    MythTV SVN: version svn10701, trunk svn 10701.

Changed how DCHP parameter override works
    Eliminated the 'minimyth.dhcp' file.
    Added DHCP override variables to the 'minimyth.conf' file.
    Added DHCP override hostname variable to the boot line.

Changed binary image to include Intel and NVIDIA support
    Modified default build to include Intel, INVIDIA, and VIA support.

Improved hardware autodection
    Moved most hardware autodetection from custom scripts to udev.

Changed from CRAMFS to SQUASHFS
    Files such as libmythtv have been getting bigger with each release of
        MythTV. With the latest SVN versions, libmythtv is approaching the
        cramfs 16MB file limit, even when stripped and optimized for size. To
        make sure that this file limit does not become a problem for those
        building custom versions of MiniMyth, the files system has been changed
        from cramfs to squashfs.
    The root file system (rootfs) is now a squashfs image rather than a cramfs
        image.
    Any minimyth.conf URL that supported cramfs images (*.cmg) now supports
        squashfs images (*.sfs) as well.
    The MM_EXTRAS_URL value 'default' now points to a squashfs image (*.sfs)
        rather than a cramfs image (*.cmg).

Improved local boot support.
    Added support for booting from an IDE disk to support CF-to-IDE adapters.
    Added 'mm_update' command to update the local boot partition with the
        latest files from the site pointed to by MM_UPDATE_URL (which is
        'http://linpvr.org/dnload/releases/latest/' by default).
    Removed the need for the MM_BOOT_TYPE boot line parameter.
    Improved the 'mkusbkey' script to better support card readers.
    Renamed the 'mkusbkey' script from 'mkusbkey' to 'mkflashboot'.
    Modified udev scripts to mount any IDE or SCSI (for USB) disk/partition
        with the label 'minimyth' as the directory '/minimyth'.
    Modified the init scripts to treat '/minimyth' rather than the TFTP server 
        as the boot directory when '/minimyth' is present.
    The disk/partition with the 'minimyth' label must be formatted as a FAT
        filesystem.

Improved init scripts
    Added lcdproc to start LCDproc server, and associated MM_LCDPROC_DRIVER
        minimyth.conf variable to set the LCDproc display driver.
    Added autodetection of USB remote control receivers and LCD/VFD displays.

Cleaned up configuration
    Made init scripts more robust by using absolute paths to binaries.
    Moved /root/.xinitrc to /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.
    Moved /root/.x11vnc to /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/x11vnc.
    Moved /root/.xscreensaver to /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver.

Cleaned up web server
    Changed http://<server>/ so that the file system is not browsable.
    Added http://<server>:8080/ for browsing the file system.

Fixed problem with the VIA VT1617a's analog power consumption
    Applied Andrey Liakhovets's patch sent to the
        openchrome-users@openchrome.org mailing list on 18 August 2006.
    The bad analog power consumption results in bad sound on some setups that
        use the VIA VT1617a, including some setups with VIA EPIA SP
        motherboards.

Added debug option to the GAR based build system
    Controlled using the mm_DEBUG variable in minimyth.conf.mk.
    When enabled (mm_DEBUG="yes"):
        Packages are compiled with the '-g' option.
        Packages are configured for debug (not all packages have updated yet).
        Symbols are not stripped when creating the MiniMyth image.
        Debugging software is included in the MiniMyth image, including
            'strace', 'gdb' and 'valgrind'.

    Added utils/mktemp.
    Added utils/squashfs.

Changes since 12:

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,   release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,     release-0-19-fixes branch svn 10143.
    MythTV SVN: version svn10177, trunk svn 10177.

Added support for booting from a USB key
    Created a script (mkusbkey) for creating a USB key that boots MiniMyth.
    Modified init scripts to read conf files from the USB key when MiniMyth is
        booted from the USB key and MM_BOOT_TYPE=usb is added to the boot
        command line.
    Added support for the conf file minimyth.dhcp when MiniMyth is booted from
        the USB key and MM_BOOT_TYPE=usb is added to the boot command line.
        The minimyth.dhcp file allows some parameters normally recieved from
        the DHCP server to be read from the minimyth.dhcp file.
    Warning it has been observed that booting VIA EPIA M and VIA EPIA MII
        motherboards from a USB key is too slow to be useful. It is not known
        what causes this problem, but since it does not happen on the ASUS
        A8N-VM CSM motherboard, it is likely a problem with the VIA EPIA
        motherboards. It is not known how to work around this problem. It is not
        known whether or not other VIA EPIA motherboards have this problem.

Changed xorg
    Changed default xorg from 'old' to 'new'.

Fixed bugs:
    Fixed bug that caused init to fail when wake-on-lan is enabled.
    Fixed bug in QT build configuration that caused playback of large files to
        fail.
    Patched MythTV to fix problem that caused higher resolution HDTV playback to
        fail on CN400 based motherboards, but it does not appear to work.
    Fixed problem with network service startup delay when local name cannot
        be resolved by DNS. Now DHCP creates a local /etc/hosts file and ns is
        configured to check the local /etc/hosts file first.

Improved the robustness of the GAR based build system
    Added explicit check for $(HOME)/.minimyth/minimyth.conf.mk.
    Added explicit check for binaries that must be installed for the build
        system to run correctly.
    Reduced the probability the non build system binaries are used
        unintentionally by the build system. Changed the binary search path 
        environment variable (PATH) so that it only includes build system
        directories, and created symbolic links in a build system directory
        for the binaries that must be installed for the build system to run
        correctly.
    Added packages that compile native environment replacements for most of the
        binaries that must be installed for the build system to run correctly
        (excluding: cvs, svn and wget, because they are only used for fetching
        source code; su, because it must be suid; getconf and ldconfig,
        because we do not replace the native environment glibc libraries; and
        perl, because it is large and takes time to compile).
    Improved error handling when CVS and SVN repositories fail during fetch.

Added packages
    Added devel/build-system-bins.
    Added devel/patch.
    Added utils/bash.

Changes since 0.19.0.1:

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,  release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,    release-0-19-fixes branch svn 9806.
    MythTV SVN: version svn9056, trunk svn 9056.

Changed version numbering scheme
    The build system is capable of building different veresion of Myth.
        As a result, it makes sense to have two independent numbers: one that
        tracks the Myth version and one that tracks the MiniMyth version.
        Therefore, the version number is <Myth-version>-<MiniMyth-version>.

Changed window manager
    Returned to ratpoison, since the new version appears to work with the
        newer versions of X and the Openchrome driver.
    Removed aewm, including X11/aewm and X11/lesstif.

Changed fonts
    Made all TTF aware applications use luxi*.ttf fonts.
    Removed all other TTF fonts.
    Removed all misc fonts except those required by Xorg, ratposion and rxvt.

Changed Xorg so that the build system supports both 6.8.2 and 7.0
    Moved xorg/fontconfig and xorg/freetype to lib/fontconfig and
        lib/freetype.
    Moved xorg to xorg-new.
    Added xorg-old for 6.8.2.
    Added mm_XORG_VERSION to minimyth.conf.mk.
    Added xorg/xorg that picks either xorg-old/xorg or xorg-new/xorg depending
        on mm_XORG_VERSION, with xorg-old/xorg beging the default.
    Made kernel/drm version depend on mm_XORG_VERSION.

Updated packages
    Reverted db/mysql (apparently MythTV 0.18.1 has problems with MySQL 5.0).
    Updated lib/ffmpeg.
    Reverted lib/libpng (newer version does not compile for x86_64).
    Updated kernel/alsa-driver.
    Updated kernel/drm.
    Reverted kernel/nvidia (newer version has trouble with DVD subtitles).

    Updated xorg/xorg-server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.19:

Added Intel support
    Added initial support for Intel chipset based motherboards. Currently,
        there is untested support for the Commell LV-675 motherboard.
    By default, Intel support is not included in the binaries. To add Intel
        support to the binaries, set mm_CHIPSETS to 'intel via' in
        minimyth.conf.mk.

Added master backend wake-on-lan support
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_MYTH_WOL_ENABLED, MM_MYTH_WOL_MAC,
        MM_MYTH_WOLSQLRECONNECTWAITTIME, MM_MYTH_WOLSQLCONNECTRETRY, and
        MM_MYTH_WOLSQLCOMMAND for controlling wake-on-lan behavior.
    Added package 'net/wakelan'.

Updated init
    Moved checking of DHCP provided values until after the telnet daemon
        is started so that users can debug DCHP problems by telnetting in.
    Changed MM_HARDWARE_* values to include both the manufacturer name and
        part number, not just the part number. With the inclusion of Intel
        and NVIDIA based motherboards, it was getting confusing.

Moved packages
    Moved utils/strace to devel/strace.

Added packages
    Added net/wakelan.
    Added xorg/xdpycopy.

    Updated xorg/xf86-video-openchrome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.11:

Added CD and DVD ripping support
    CD ripping supports transcoding. MythMusic requires the audio encoders
        independent of whether or not you want to include CD ripping.
    DVD ripping does not support transcoding. MythDVD uses 'transcode' to
        transcode the ripped DVD. 'transcode' would add an extra 2MB to the
        image just to be able to convert the DVD to a format that cannot be
        hardware MPEG2 decoded. Therefore, 'transcode' is not included.
        However, if you add 'transcode' and its associated libraries, then
        MiniMyth will use it.

Updated init
    Changed MiniMyth to search for its configuration files in
        'conf/<hostname>' then 'conf/default', rather than 'conf/<hostname>'
        then 'conf'.
    Removed support for specal value 'default' from MM_CODECS_URL.
    Removed support for specal value 'default' from MM_THEMECACHE_URL.
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_THEME_NAME and MM_THEME_URL for
        setting the MythTV theme and adding the MythTV theme named
        MM_THEME_NAME located at the URL MM_THEME_URL to the MythTV
        theme directory.
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_THEMEOSD_NAME and MM_THEMEOSD_URL for
        setting the MythTV OSD theme and adding the MythTV OSD theme named
        MM_THEMEOSD_NAME located at the URL MM_THEMEOSD_URL to the MythTV
        theme directory.
    Added 'userspace' value for MM_CPUFREQ_GOVERNOR.
    Added minimyth.conf variable MM_MYTHDVD_URL for setting the remote
        directory where MiniMyth will create the temporary directory used by
        MythDVD's when ripping DVDs.

Updated Busybox support
    Updated version.
    Removed many unused utilities.
    Added hwclock utility, replacing standalone utility.

Updated Xorg support
    Updated version.
    Changed from monolithic version to modular version, replacing X11/X11,
        X11/libXvMCW, X11/unichrome_dri and lib/libdrm with the packages in
        xorg.
    Updated X11/unichrome version and moved X11/unichrome to
        xorg/xf86-video-openchrome.
    Updated X11/unichrome_dri version and moved X11/unichrome_dri to xorg/Mesa.
    Updated lib/libdrm version and moved lib/lidrm to xorg/libdrm.
    Changed the installation location of Xorg from /usr/X11R6 to /usr.
    NOTE: As part of the Xorg update, the installion path of many items
        referenced in the xorg.conf file have changed. Therefore, if you have
        a custom xorg.conf file, then you will need to update these locations.
           /usr/X11R6               -> /usr
           /usr/X11R6/lib/modules   -> /usr/lib/xorg/modules
           /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts -> /usr/lib/X11/fonts
           /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb   -> /usr/share/X11/rgb

Moved packages
    Moved devel/pkgconfig to devel/pkg-config.
    Moved lib/libdrm to xorg/libdrm.
    Moved myth/myth*-stable to myth/myth*-stable18.

    Updated xorg/xf86-video-openchrome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.10:

Updated build system
    Updated packages to cross compile for x86_64. This uncovered some problems
        where gcc and glibc were not maintaining a clean separation between the
        native and cross environments. Also, this resulted in a platform
        independent method for determining library dependencies.
    Added x86_64 support, currently mm_GARCH=athlon64.
    Changed native system build to use system's architecture rather than
        pentium-mmx.

Added NVIVIA support
    Added initial support for NVIDIA chipset based motherboards. Everything
        should work on the ASUS A8N-VM CSM motherboard, except XvMC (which is
        not supported by the NVIDIA driver yet) and surround sound (which is
        disabled as a result of a hack to kernel/alsa-driver that is needed to
        get rid of a high pitched whine). No other motherboards are supported.
    By default, NVIDIA support is not included in the binaries. To add NVIDIA
        support to the binaries, set mm_CHIPSETS to 'nvidia via' in
        minimyth.conf.mk.

Added hdpram
    Added hdparm (and the corresponding disk/hdparm package) so that users
        can adjust CD/DVD drive parameters.

Updated init
    Moved mythtv init script to the end after all init scripts other than x.
        This allows users to override Myth database setting set by other
        init scripts by putting the settings in the minimyth.conf file.
    Added hardware clock setting to shutdown.
    Added minimyth.conf attribute MM_X_DVI_ENABLED for enabling the DVI
        output. Since the Openchrome drivers do not support DVI, it is likely
        that this attribute will not work on VIA chipset motherboards.
    Added MM_CPUFREQ_GOVERNOR for controlling CPU frequency scaling.
    Fixed problem with MM_X_MODELINE not working.

Removed smb/smbfs support
    Removed smb/smbfs support. There should be no reason to be using smb/smbfs
    rather than cifs.
    Removed package net/samba.
    Added package net/mount.cifs.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated kernel/linux.
    Updated lib/libexif.
    Updated lib/libtiff.
    Updated lib/libusb.
    Updated lirc/lirc.
    Updated myth/mythplugins-stable.
    Updated myth/mythtv-stable.
    Updated system/udev.
    Updated system/zoneinfo.
    Updated utils/strace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.9:

Updated init
    Fixed bug that caused minimyth.script to be required.
    Fixed bug that caused tarfile (*.tar.bz2) conf and tftp URLs to fail to be
        downloaded and mounted by mm_url_mount.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated kernel/linux.
    Updated system/zoneinfo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.8:

Added awk
    Updated package utils/busybox to include awk.

Added lsdvd
    Added package utils/lsdvd.

Updated init
    Changed graphical boot from bootsplash to gensplash. Gensplash runs in
        userspace, eliminating the need for a kernel patch. In support of this
        the package system/bootsplash was removed and the package
        system/splashutils was added.
    Enabled graphical boot provided that the kernel only logs errors to the
        console, and the frame buffer resolution is 800x600 with a color depth
        of 16-bits or more.
    Patched the kernel that so by default the kernel only logs errors to the
        console, and the frame buffer resolution is 800x600 with a color depth
        of 32-bits.
    Changed to the init from sysvinit rather than the init from busybox, because
        the init from busybox leaves zombie processes. In support of this the
        package system/sysvinit was added.
    Changed init scripts, including
        moving rc from /etc to /etc/rc.d,
        moving init scripts from /etc/minimyth.d to /etc/rc.d/init.d, and
        moving configuration files to /etc/conf and /etc/conf.d.
    Added support for mounting a binary codecs directory for MPlayer and Xine
        using the variable MM_CODECS_URL.
    Added support for downloading and mounting cramfs images to *_URL
        variables by adding the support to the mm_url_mount function.
    Changed the default values for MM_EXTRAS_URL and MM_THEMECACHE_URL from
        tarfiles (*.tar.bz2) to a cramfs images (*.cmg).

Updated LIRC support
    Replaced driver specific lircd daemons with one unified daemon.
    Added reasonable defaults for MM_LIRC_DEVICE when MM_LIRC_DRIVER is set to
        imon or streamzap.

Updated mm_* commands
    Moved all mm_* commands into /etc/rc.d/functions and made them accessable
        at the command line using the single command mm_command.

Updated MPlayer and Xine
    Change MPlayer and Xine to look for binary codecs in the directory
        /usr/lib/codecs rather than /usr/lib/win32, since both MPlayer
        and Xine use /usr/lib/codecs as the default binary codecs directory.

Fixed Xine so that it obeys MM_AUDIO_TYPE
    Fixed bug in the xine configuration file.

Modified Myth frontend menus
    Removed Import menu items, because CD and DVD importing is not supported.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated devel/gcc*.
    Updated devel/gdb.
    Updated devel/glibc*.
    Updated kernel/alsa-driver.
    Updated kernel/drm.
    Updated kernel/linux.

    Updated lib/libvorbis.
    Updated lib/ncurses.
    Updated lirc/lirc*.
    Updated mediaplayers/xine-lib.
    Updated myth/mythplugins.
    Updated myth/mythtv.
    Updated net/samba.
    Updated system/udev.
    Updated system/zoneinfo.
    Updated utils/alsa-utils.
    Updated utils/strace.
    Updated X11/aewm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.7:

Updated init
    Changed init to start logging and telnet before fetching and running
        minimyth.conf and minimyth.script. This allows logs and remote access
        to the MiniMyth front end as early as possible.
    Changed syslog to get the remote log server address from DHCP rather than
        minimyth.conf.
    Added a check to make sure that MiniMyth can connect to the Myth database.
    Changed init to not start a console or tty1 shell because they interfere
        with the bootsplash screen. However, there are now shells on tty2, tty3,
        tty4 and tty5 (and X is now on tty6).
    Stopped disabling X when debugging is enabled. If you want to disable X,
        then use MM_X_ENABLED=no.

Updated minimyth.conf
    Replaced MM_SOUND with MM_AUDIO_TYPE.
    Obsoleted MM_SOUND.
    Obsoleted MM_SYSLOG_SERVER.
    Added MM_VIDEO_ASPECT_RATIO to set the video aspect ratio. Right now, this
        is only used to control the aspect ratio for MPlayer. However, in the
        future, it may be use to clean up some of the MM_X controls.
    Added MM_VIDEO_DEINTERLACE_ENABLED to enable bob deinterlacing. This
        controls bob deinterlacing in MythTV, Xine and MPlayer.

Updated MPlayer
    Added Chris Audley's XvMC fallback patch (version 2). This enables MPlayer
        to fall back to a different video output and codec when the file
        cannot be played using XvMC with MPEG2 acceleration.
    Updated the MPlayer configuration file (/root/.mplayer/config) to enable
        MPlayer to take advantage of the XvMC fallback patch.

Added MythNews support
    Enabled the MythNews plugin.
    Added MM_MYTHNEWS_ENABLED to minimyth.conf.

Added Theora support
    Added Theora for philisophical reasons. There is no Theora content (yet).
        However, like Vorbis, Theora is a completely open codec, which is
        something that should be supported.
    Added package lib/libtheora.
    Enabled Theora support packages myth/mplayer and myth/xine-lib.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated devel/bison.
    Updated devel/libtool.
    Updated kernel/drm.
    Updated kernel/linux.
    Updated kernel/unionfs.
    Updated kernel/vt1121.
    Updated lib/libdrm.

    Updated myth/mplayer.
    Updated qt/qt.
    Updated system/udev.
    Updated utils/lm_sensors.
    Updated utils/util-linux.
    Updated X11/SDL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.6:

Updated X support
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_X_DISPLAYSIZE_X and MM_X_DISPLAYSIZE_Y to
        control the horizonatal display size and the vertical display size
        respectively.

Made root file system read/write
    Used pivot_root to make root file system read/write.

Changed X window manager
    Changed X window manager from ratpoison to aewm, because ratpoison was
        causing crashes with new Unichrome driver and with upcoming X11R6.9.
    Disabled X window manager by default, because MythTV "GUI X offset" and
        "GUI Y offset" settings do not work when the X window manager running.
    Added packages X11/aewm and X11/lesstif.

Updated Mesa support
    Changed X11/X11 so that it no longer builds libOSMesa.
    Added packages X11/Mesa and lib/libdrm.
    Removed package X11/unichrome_dri because it is replaced by package X11/Mesa.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated kernel/drm.
    Updated kernel/linux.
    Updated lib/libcdaudio.
    Updated lirc/lirc.
    Updated net/samba.
    Updated system/udev.
    Updated X11/unichrome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.5:
