Modified init
    - Added MM_X_FETCH_XBINDKEYSRC.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer multi-threading patches.
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer VAAPI patches.
    - Updated Xine VDPAU patch.

Modified LIRC
    - Added support for the Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc remote control.
    - Changed LIRC to use syslog rather than its own log file.
    - Changed some of hte key names in lircd.conf and lircrc files so that
      they are valid linux/input.h key names:
        - Changed KEY_ASPECTRATIO (which is not in linux/input.h) to KEY_ZOOM.
          KEY_ZOOM maps to both the "Aspect Ratio" and "Zoom" buttons. KEY_ZOOM
          controls the aspect ratio.
        - Changed KEY_IMAGE (which is not in linux/input.h) to KEY_MEDIA.
          KEY_MEDIA maps to the "My Pictures" key.
        - Changed KEY_AUDIO to KEY_MP3.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed a bug that caused mm_sleep and mm_sleep_on_ss to output an error
      messages when either mm_external_power_off or mm_external_power_on were
      not present.
    - Fixed a bug in the checking of mythfrontend location state when using
      MythTV 0.22. MythTV changed from returning 'MainMenu' to returning
      'mainmenu' when the location is queried through the network control
      interface.
    - Fixed a bug in MythStream's YouTube parser in MythTV trunk caused by a
      change in YouTube's web page format.
    - Fixed a bug that caused MythStream to crash in MythTV trunk due to
      streams.res not being present.
    - Fixed a bug where init would reject MM_X_TV_TYPE='PAL-D' for nvidia
      driver.
    - Fixe a bug that caused MythTV 0.22's MythBrowser to crash when attempting
      to display Adobe Flash.

Fixed build system
    - Modified the configure arguments in lib/fontconfig's Makefile so that its
      configure script will not look for fonts elsewhere as this will cause it
      to look for font paths on the local system.
    - Modified X11/xscreensaver's Makefile to work around a problem caused by
      by xscreensaver's broken use of intltools.
    - Modified X11/libva's Makefile so that it does not install libva-compat.la.
    - Modified gtk/gtk+ so that it compiles with minimal rather than no
      debugging as doing so stops (at least some) crashing of MythTV 0.22's
      MythBrowser when displaying Adobe Flash.
