    MythTV 0.22:         version 0.22.0,         release-0-22-fixes branch svn 22957.
    MythTV trunk:        version trunk.22939     trunk svn 22939.

Modified init
    - Added MM_X_FETCH_XBINDKEYSRC.
    - Changed the default from MM_HULU_REMOTE to 'devinput' to 'mceusb' because
      'devinput' is the default remote name for eventlircd.
    - Changed hotplug udev scripts so that they are disabled initially.
    _ Added the init script hotplug to enable the hotplug udev scripts.

Improved MythTV slave backend support
    - Added firmware autodetection for the Technotrend-Budget/Hauppauge
      WinTV-NOVA-T DVB.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer multi-threading patches.
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer VAAPI patches.
    - Updated Xine VDPAU patch.

Modified LIRC
    - Switched to eventlircd for final lircd output.
        - Makes it easier to handle multiple remote controls.
        - Makes it easier to handle remotes that generate keyboard shortcuts.
        - Makes it easier to handle remotes that are not present at boot time
          (e.g. Sony PS3 Blu-ray Disk remote control).
        - Makes it possible to handle hotplugging.
        - NOTE: if you are using a custom lircd.conf file, then you must make
          sure that the key names are in the LIRC namespace (which you can
          find by running 'irrecord --show-namespace') and start with KEY_
          not BTN_.
        - NOTE: if you are using a custom lircrc file, then you must make
          sure that the entries are not restricted to a specific remotes
          using remote=<remote-name>, as eventlircd does not forward remote
          names.
    - Switched from udev based detection to udev based hotplug.
    - Added support for the Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc remote control.
    - Changed LIRC to use syslog rather than its own log file.
    - Changed some of the key names in lircd.conf and lircrc files so that
      they are valid LIRC namespace key names:
        - Changed KEY_ASPECTRATIO  to KEY_ZOOM.
          KEY_ZOOM maps to both the "Aspect Ratio" and "Zoom" buttons. KEY_ZOOM
          controls the aspect ratio.
        - Changed KEY_IMAGE to KEY_MEDIA.
          KEY_MEDIA maps to the "My Pictures" key.
        - Changed KEY_AUDIO to KEY_MP3.
        - Changed KEY_GUIDE (which is not in linux/input.h) to KEY_PROGRAM.
    - Patched LIRC so that lircd's uinput output supports all keys and buttons.
    - Simplified lircrc by moving custom key mapping for MCE and Hauppauge
      remotes from lircrc to lircd.conf.
    - Simplified lircrc by removing MCE shortcut key mapping from lircrc as
      they should be handled by either lircd or eventlircd.
    - Simplified lircrc by removing KEY_KPn and KEY_NUMERIC_n as KEY_KPn and
      KEY_NUMERIC_n should be mapped to KEY_n by either lircd or eventlircd.
    - Patched bdremote-ng used for bdremote support so that it has an event
      device output.
    - Moved event device support from lircd to eventlircd.
    - Modified scripts so that they enable wake-on-usb using /sys rather than
      /proc.

Modified Xorg
    - Updated xorg-server udev patch.

Modified kernel
    - Disabled /proc/acpi/event as the new version of acpid no longer needs
      it.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed a bug that caused mm_sleep and mm_sleep_on_ss to output an error
      messages when either mm_external_power_off or mm_external_power_on were
      not present.
    - Fixed a bug in the checking of mythfrontend location state when using
      MythTV 0.22. MythTV changed from returning 'MainMenu' to returning
      'mainmenu' when the location is queried through the network control
      interface.
    - Fixed a bug in MythStream's YouTube parser in MythTV trunk caused by a
      change in YouTube's web page format.
    - Fixed a bug that caused MythStream to crash in MythTV trunk due to
      streams.res not being present.
    - Fixed a bug where init would reject MM_X_TV_TYPE='PAL-D' for nvidia
      driver.
    - Fixed a bug that caused MythTV 0.22's MythBrowser to crash when attempting
      to display Adobe Flash.
    - Fixed a bug that caused MiniMyth to fail to detect the input device
      usb device with VendorId=0003 and ProductId=0419 as an LIRC device.
    - Fixed a bug in MM_LIRC.pm that made it impossible to configure LIRC to
      use the udp driver.

Fixed build system
    - Modified the configure arguments in lib/fontconfig's Makefile so that its
      configure script will not look for fonts elsewhere as this will cause it
      to look for font paths on the local system.
    - Modified X11/xscreensaver's Makefile to work around a problem caused by
      by xscreensaver's broken use of intltools.
    - Modified X11/libva's Makefile so that it does not install libva-compat.la.
    - Modified gtk/gtk+ so that it compiles with minimal rather than no
      debugging as doing so stops (at least some) crashing of MythTV 0.22's
      MythBrowser when displaying Adobe Flash.
    - Added a work around to a bug in AM_PATH_SDL that causes packages that
      require SDL to find the wrong sdl-config.
    - Fixed compilation of devel/strace with Linux 2.6.32.
    - Updated lib/libacl and lib/libattr master site URLs.
