    - Patched FFmpeg so that it has multi-threading support.
    - Patched MPlayer (SVN version) so that it has multi-threading support.

Modified udev
    - Modified udev scripts so that they use the new blkid rather than the
      obsoleted vol_id.

Modified kernel
    - Added dvb-usb-dib0700 related drivers.
    - Added ext2 driver.
    - Added 8021q driver.
    - Added pl2303 driver.
    - Compiled into the kernel the drivers needed to for local boot without a
      RAM file system image
          - Compiled in drivers for booting from a USB flash drive.
          - Compiled in drivers for booting from an ATA hard drive.
          - Compiled in drivers need for the ext2 and ext3 file systems.
    - Disabled tickless clock in hopes that it will cure the unresponsive
      remote control issue.
    - Switched from 1000Hz to 300Hz interrupts. Hopefully, things have changed
      in the kernel enough that the problem mentioned here has been fixed:
      <http://www.minimyth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6322>

Modified network access
    - Replaced webfsd with lighttpd.

Modified mm_local_*
    - Replaced tftp and wget with curl.

Modified build system
    - Added mm_SOFTWARE value 'vlan' for including VLAN releated software.
    - Added GNU Free Document License 1.3.
    - Changed the default build configuration.
    - Removed tftp and wget from busybox as they have been replaced by curl.

Fixed bugs
    - Enabled compatibility mode in xkeyboard-config in order to fix the
      <http://www.minimyth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2258>.
    - Fixed a bug that caused failure to fetch minimyth.conf when using a
      atftpd server.
    - Added fix a for the Xorg intel video driver's HDMI audio problem:
      <http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21371>.
    - Fixed a bug that caused MythBrowser to fail due to dcopserver not
      starting, which was caused by the x init script not correctly setting
      the permissions on /tmp/.ICE-unix.
    - Changed the x init script so that it only loads Xorg freetype module
      when the xorg-server version is less than 1.6 as 1.6.x has built in
      freetype support.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed devel/binutils so that it builds static libraries as well.
    - Patched kde/kdelibs so that parallel build is more reliable.
    - Added the library xserver/protocol.txt used by xorg-server 1.6.x.
    - Changed image build scripts so that they include the directories
      qt4/plugins/{graphicssystems|iconengines|imageformats|sqldrivers}.
    - Enabled QtDBus support in qt/qt4 so that QtWebKit.pc's Requires does not
      fail. I do not know why QtDBus is required by QtWebKit as QtWebKit is
      not linked to QtDBus.
    - Added additional files to the lists associated with mm_SOFTWARE's flash
      options in an attempt to fix segfaults when using libflashplayer.so.

                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV 0.21:         version 0.21.0,         release-0-21-fixes branch svn 20409 and

    MythTV trunk:        version trunk.20411     trunk svn 20411.

Improved init
    - Stopped creating /var as separate tmpfs file system as this was left was
      left over from when the root file system was not read-write.
    - Stopped creating /var/log as separate limited size tmpfs file systems as
      this was left over from when /var/log/messages was not limited in size.
    - Stopped creating /tmp and /var/tmp as separate limited size tmpfs file
      because limiting tmp to too small a directory can break some functions.
    - Added generation of /var/lib/dbus/machine-id to the gtk init script when
      /usr/bin/dbus-uuidgen is present.
    - Added generation of /etc/pango/pango.modules to the gtk init script when
      /usr/bin/pango-querymodules is present.
    - Added /dev/disk/by-kernel and /dev/disk/by-uuid symbol links.

Modified kernel
    - Added the f71882fg driver.
    - Enabled IP multicast to so the kernel can drop IPTV multicast traffic.
    - Added the snd-ali5451 ALSA sound driver.
    - Renamed files in /etc/modprobe.d so that they end with .conf because
      this will be required by future versions of module-init-tools.

Modified ALSA
    - Added the snd-ali5451 ALSA sound driver.

Modified LIRC
    - Added lircd.conf for the iMON RM100 remote.

Modified Xorg
    - Removed the NVIDIA libwfb module as Xorg already includes one.

    - Removed the lirc_cmdir kernel module from the library list since it has
      been removed from lirc.
    - Added LGPL3 license.
    - Changed default build so that it includes libraries needed for Adobe
      Flash (rather than gnash) when building for MythTV trunk because some
      common Flash AV formats do not work in gnash.

Fixed build system
    - Added missing lib/SDL build dependency to lib/agg.
    - Changed master sites for emulators/zsnes and lib/libwiimote so that they
      match the master site used for all other packages that download from
      sourceforge.

    - Added Intel Graphics Package 2008Q4 patch for 2.6.28
      <http://intellinuxgraphics.org/2008Q4.html>.
    - Patched kernel so that the LIRC driver lirc_gpio works.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Patched MPlayer SVN with the VDPAU 'line 704 hack' patch.

Modified LIRC
    - Added lircd.conf files for the Hauppauge R808 and Hauppauge A415 remotes
      using the PVR-250 card receiver.
    - Updated to CVS 20090116Z in order to add support for the latest iMON
      devices as well as autodetection
        - This causes /sys/module/lirc_imon/parameters/is_lcd to no longer be
          available, but with autodetection is should no longer be needed.
    - Added iMON lircd.conf file with 64-bit codes in support of the latest
      iMON driver.
    - Enabled lirc_gpio.
    - Added support for MCE keyboard by patching lirc_mceusb2 with a patch
      created from lirc_mce_mod 0.2.0 found here
      <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-mce> and updated for current LIRC.
         - It has not been tested.

Modified LCDproc
    - Replaced the picolcd driver with the picolcd 4x20 driver from
      <http://resources.mini-box.com/online/picolcd/4x20/lcdproc-picolcd20x4-0.5.2-cvs.tgz>.
      This allows
         - The driver to compile because it no longer depends on liblcdusb.
         - Support for 4x20 displays.
         - Support for LIRC.
    - The driver has not be verified to work.
    - The LIRC support has not been verified to work.
    - The LIRC support has not been integrated into MiniMyth's init system.

Modified Xorg
    - Changed xinit's xserverrc file so that it redirects Xorg's stderr/stdout
      to /dev/null since it is logged to /var/log/Xorg.0.0.log already.

Modified init
    - Added detection of i2c lirc devices.
    - Added support for loading firmware (as long as it is present in
      '/lib/firmware').
    - Added support for detecting and fetching required tuner firmware files.
    - Added MM_BACKEND_TUNER_FIRMWARE_FILE_LIST.
    - Removed user 'root' MythTV configuration files (i.e.
      /root/.mythtv/config.xml and /root/.mythtv/mysql.txt) because all
      MythTV programs (mythbackend, mythfrontend and mythwelcome) run as user
      'minimyth'.
    - Added support for loading coretemp kernel driver on more hardware.
    - Added check for trailing '/' in MM_MINIMYTH_CONF_BOOT_URL.
    - Modified the default values of MM_EXTRAS_URL, MM_THEME_URL and
      MM_THEMEOSD_URL so that it uses 'confro' rather than 'hunt' when the
      root file system is not a squahsfs image.
    - Modified the 'dist' url expansion to that it expands to empty when the
      root file system is not a squashfs image.
    - Stopped changing the gid of the directory tree /srv/www to httpd as it
      is not needed (group and other have the same access) and it causes the
      files to be copied from read-only branch to read-write branch of the
      unionfs union.
    - Changed tftp URLs from using tftp to using curl as the latest curl claims
      to fix the TFTP timeout bugs.
    - Changed how uid's and gid's are set so that we do not set uid's and
      gid's that are already correctly set. This reduces the number of files
      that are copied from the read-only branch to the read-write branch of
      the unionfs union.
    - Changed http gets and puts so that they follow redirects as they did
      before switching from using wget to using curl.
    - Changed perl init scripts so that they use return values rather than
      the /var/log/minimyth.err.log file to trigger failure.
    - Changed perl init scripts so that they do not create
      /var/log/minimyth.err.log.

Modified udev
    - Renamed 06-minimyth-mythtv.rules to 07-minimyth-mythtv.rules.
    - Added 05-minimyth-detect-tuner.rules for detecting tuner cards.
    - Added 06-minimyth-firmware.rules for loading firmware.
    - Renamed mm_uid to mm_persistent.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed a bug that caused there to be no PCI devices in /dev/persistent.
    - Fixed missing DVB support in MythTV 0.20 and 0.20 softpad.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause DHCP to fail to use MM_DHCP_* variables.
    - Fixed a bug that caused perl init scripts to not fail when required file
      was not fetched from the read-only configuration directory.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause perl init scripts to create the wrong value
      of MM_HARDWARE_KERNEL_MODULES.
    - Added missing tfp410.so Xorg module needed by the intel Xorg driver.
    - Applied
      <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/anholt/drm-intel.git;a=commit;h=2052746fc8397130c120f0194a89938b0b62b6cb>
      to the 2.6.26 kernel (already in the 2.6.27 and newer kernels) to fix
      the problem mentioned here
      <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2008-October/039591.html>.
    - Fixed a bug that would cause MM_X_MODELINE_0, MM_X_MODELINE_1 and
      MM_X_MODELINE_2 to fail with perl init scripts.
    - Fixed bug that identified MM_PLUGIN_DVD_ENABLED as obsolete even though
      it is not.
    - Fixed a bug in LIRC that caused it to create the wrong sysfs device
      link, which prevented access to bInterfaceNumber.
    - Fixed a bug with the security init script not setting the ownership
      permissions on home direcotry for the user 'minimyth' after set the uid
      and gid for the user 'minimyth'.
    - Added missing vmware video driver dependency: shadowfb.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented LCDd.conf from being fetched from the conf
      directory when using perl init scripts.

Modified build system
    - Modified include file lists so that LIRC drivers are included
      individually rather than including all the LIRC drivers.
    - Modified include file lists so that lirc_gpio and lirc_i2c drivers are
      included only when the backend software is included.
    - Changed mksquashfs so that it uses more conservative settings. I hope
      that this will reduce the chance of creating bad squashfs images.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed lib/libftdi so that it does detect the system's boost library and
      so that it does not require the boost library even though it is
      included in MiniMyth.
    - Fixed a bug in kernel-2.6.28/linux that could cause packages that
      include linux/serial.h to fail to compile.
    - Fixed a bug when compiling MythTV 0.20 or 0.21 with the 2.6.28 linux
      headers by backporting MythTV SVN changeset 19245.
    - Cleaned up xorg-7.3/Mesa nd xorg-7.4/Mesa patches.

Modified init scripts
    - Obsoleted sh init scripts. MM_INIT_TYPE=sh will no longer work.
    - Improved perl init script error messages, including minimyth.pm.
    - Cleaned up 'error:' and 'warning:' prefixes in error messages for perl
      init scripts.
    - Improved messages logged when fetching files using perl init scripts.
    - Improved handling of 'dist:' URLs when using local boot.
    - Switched from 'require {package};' to 'use {package} ();' in perl init

Modified MiniMyth configuration
    - Obsoleted MM_WIIMOTE_ENABLED.

Modified MiniMyth.pm
    - Removed member functions 'url_confro_get', 'url_confrw_get',
      'url_dist_get', 'url_file_get', 'url_http_get', 'url_hunt_get' and
      'url_tftp_get'. Scripts should have been using 'url_get'.
    - Removed member functions 'url_confrw_put', 'url_file_get', 'url_http_get'
      and 'url_tftp_get'. Scripts should have been using 'url_put'.
    - Added 'url_expand' for exanding a URL into a prioritized list of URLs.
    - Changed 'url_get' and 'url_put' so that they use 'url_expand'.

Modified kernel
    - Added the at11e Ethernet driver.

Modified Xorg
    - Combined keyboard and mouse udev detection rules into event detection
      rule.
    - Added wiimote to detected event devices.
    - Added support for numerous event devices in xorg.conf rather than just
      one keyboard and one mouse.
    - Added vmware video driver to the default binary image.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Modified init so that it configures MythTV to use xv rather than vdpau
      when MM_VIDEO_DECODER='vdpau' and MythTV is either version 0.20.x or
      version 0.21.x.
    - Updated FFmpeg VDPAU support.
    - Updated MPlayer VDPAU support.
    - Updated Xine VDPAU support.

Modified Wiimote
    - Improved checking for whether or not a Wiimote is in use before
      initializing during init.
    - Enabled remote LED to indicate remote number.

Modified udev rules
    - Prepended kernel device name (without instance) to the persistent device
      link. This is needed for hardware that creates multiple device types (e.g.
      the Wiimote).
    - Added persistent device links for the Wiimote.
    - Removed obsolete udev rules and script that where used used create
      quasi-persistent input device names.
    - Changed the location of bash from /usr/bin to /bin.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed a bug that prevented Wiimote devices from working.

      enabled in minimyth.conf but no bluetooth device was present.
    - Fixed a bug that cuased MM_VIDEO_RESIZE_ENABLED to default to 'no'
      rather than ''.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the DHCP client to not restart correctly
      when being restarted so that it would use the DHCP override variables in
      minimyth.conf.
    - Fixed a bug where error messages were logged with the deprecated 'error'
      level rather than the 'err' level.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the fakeroot script to use the wrong shell.
    - Fixed spurious warnings in the web.pm and x.pm init scripts.
    - Fixed a bug that would cause a non-bootable USB HID device to not be
      detected as a valid event input device for X.
    - Fixed an error in the documentation of MM_THEME_FILE_MENU_ADD.

Modified build system
    - Enabled building of wmgui in utils/cwiid package.
    - Removed MythStream parsers that claim to be perl but are actually bash.

Fixed build system
    - Patched lib/bluez, lib/dbus and net/portmap so that their binaries are
      recognized as executables rather than shared objects by disabling gcc pie
      or replacing it with gcc pic.
    - Fixed a bug in package xorg-7.4/xorg-server's Makefile that caused it to
