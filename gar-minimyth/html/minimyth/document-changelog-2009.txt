      to enable/disable Xorg input (event) devices.
    - Separated Bluetooth init from Wiimote init.
    - Separated D-Bus init from GTK init.
    - Added MM_BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_LIST for specifying the Bluetooth devices to

      WinTV-HVR-2250.

Improved LIRC
    - Added autodetection of the GoTView USB Remote (0419:0001).
    - Modified LIRC wakeup enabling so that it works for any USB LIRC device
      (of course the USB LIRC hardware needs to have Wake-on-USB support).

Improved Xorg
    - Patched xorg-server to add udev hotplug support for input devices.

Modified kernel
    - Added hid-samsung.ko kernel module.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed bug that would cause unneeded shutdown delay when not in main menu
      <http://www.minimyth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=2480>.
    - Fixed bug that caused "Fetch and Save Codecs" to appear three times in
      the MiniMyth menu in MythTV 0.22.

    - Added support for devices that use the cx25840 driver.
    - Added support for FireWire (IEEE 1394) controlled set top boxes.
    - Added support for budget capture devices (e.g. Nova-PCI), including the

      flickering.
    - Updated Apple and Youtube parsers.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Updated Xine VDPAU patch.
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer VAAPI patches.
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer multi-threading patches.

      controlled set top boxes.
    - Added asus_atk0110.ko kernel module.
    - Added hid-logitech.ko kernel module.
    - Added cx25840.ko kernel module.
    - Added budget.ko, budget-av.ko and budget-ci.ko kernel modules.
    - Added snd-cs5535audio.ko ALSA sound driver.
    - Added scx200_acb.ko kernel module used by some geode hardware.
    - Added lm90.ko sensor kernel module used by some geode hardware.
    - Added tulip network driver, which is used by Virtual PC.
    - Added hdpvr.ko kernel module.
    - Added some configuration options that udev may want.
    - Updated unionfs patch to 2.5.3.
    - Patched 2.6.30 to fix the via drm vblank bug, which was fixed in 2.6.31.
    - Patched 2.6.30 and 2.6.30 to add support for the Intel Atom CPU to the
      coretemp.ko kernel module.

Fixed bugs
    - Patched MythStream in MythTV trunk so that it uses QX11Info::display
      instead of qt_xdisplay().
    - Fixed bug that caused the frontend's webpage to not display the output
      of /proc/loadavg.
    - Fixed e100 kernel driver by enabling firmware inclusion in the kernel.
    - Enabled control by the xpad driver of the Xbox 360 controller LED.

Modified build system
    - Changed how *_config and *-config scripts that some packages install and
      some packages use to determine configuration information about other
      packages. In the past, the build system pactched each package that
      looked for one of these scripts. Now the build system has the package
      install these in a separate location and adds this location to the path.
      This reduces the size of the patches and reduces the chance that a
      package that needed to be patched was not patched.
    - Added the Graphite theme to MythTV trunk.
    - Patched myth-*/mythstream packages to removed gcc warnings.
    - Added python for packages that need it to build, including xorg's xcb.
    - Added tcl for packages that need it to build, including sqlite.
    - Added hulu to the software list.
    - Made flash the default as Hulu Desktop requires it.

Fixed build system
    - Patched kernel-2.6.*/linux so that it uses ncurses from the build
      environment rather than the local system.
    - Patched lib/ncurses so that its *-config file gives out the correct
      values for installation paths.
    - Patched system/g15daemon so that it does not add includedir to CPPFLAGS.
    - Modified db/mysql compiler options to fix problems on x86_64 targets,
      see <http://www.minimyth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2393>.
    - Fixed bug that caused utils/pciutils to no install headers needed to use
      libpci.

      rather than myth-update for updating the source code.
    - Removed gcc 4.3.x patch files.

Fixed build system

      atftpd server.
    - Added fix a for the Xorg intel video driver's HDMI audio problem:
      <http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21371>.
    - Fixed a bug that caused MythBrowser to fail due to dcopserver not
      starting, which was caused by the x init script not correctly setting
      the permissions on /tmp/.ICE-unix.
    - Changed the x init script so that it only loads Xorg freetype module
      when the xorg-server version is less than 1.6 as 1.6.x has built in
      freetype support.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed devel/binutils so that it builds static libraries as well.
    - Patched kde/kdelibs so that parallel build is more reliable.
    - Added the library xserver/protocol.txt used by xorg-server 1.6.x.
    - Changed image build scripts so that they include the directories
      qt4/plugins/{graphicssystems|iconengines|imageformats|sqldrivers}.
    - Enabled QtDBus support in qt/qt4 so that QtWebKit.pc's Requires does not
      fail. I do not know why QtDBus is required by QtWebKit as QtWebKit is
      not linked to QtDBus.
    - Added additional files to the lists associated with mm_SOFTWARE's flash
      options in an attempt to fix segfaults when using libflashplayer.so.

                                                 softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV 0.20:         version 0.20.2,         release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082, and
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV 0.21:         version 0.21.0,         release-0-21-fixes branch svn 20409 and
                                                 patch glvdpau20300-3.
    MythTV trunk:        version trunk.20411     trunk svn 20411.

Improved init
    - Stopped creating /var as separate tmpfs file system as this was left was
      left over from when the root file system was not read-write.
    - Stopped creating /var/log as separate limited size tmpfs file systems as
      this was left over from when /var/log/messages was not limited in size.
    - Stopped creating /tmp and /var/tmp as separate limited size tmpfs file
      because limiting tmp to too small a directory can break some functions.
    - Added generation of /var/lib/dbus/machine-id to the gtk init script when
      /usr/bin/dbus-uuidgen is present.
    - Added generation of /etc/pango/pango.modules to the gtk init script when
      /usr/bin/pango-querymodules is present.
    - Added /dev/disk/by-kernel and /dev/disk/by-uuid symbol links.
    - Added boot line variable MM_MINIMYTH_BOOT_DEVICE for overriding the
      device that MiniMyth will mount as the local MiniMyth boot directory
      /minimyth.
    - Added MiniMyth configuration variables MM_AUDIO_GAIN,
      MM_AUDIO_FETCH_ASOUND_CONF and MM_AUDIO_FETCH_ASOUND_STATE.
    - Added MiniMyth configuration variable MM_X_OUTPUT_HDMI.

Modified kernel
    - Added the f71882fg driver.
    - Enabled IP multicast to so the kernel can drop IPTV multicast traffic.
    - Added the snd-ali5451 ALSA sound driver.
    - Renamed files in /etc/modprobe.d so that they end with .conf because
      this will be required by future versions of module-init-tools.

Modified ALSA
    - Added the snd-ali5451 ALSA sound driver.

Modified LIRC
    - Added lircd.conf for the iMON RM100 remote.

Modified Xorg
    - Removed the NVIDIA libwfb module as Xorg already includes one.

Fixed bugs
    - Added Mesa x8r8g8b8 fbconfig fix referenced in
      <http://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mythtv/+bug/341898>.

    - Fixed a bug that would cause lirc_imon to unload without first unloading
      imon_vfd.
    - Fixed a bug in the security init script that caused it to not change the
      ownership of symbolic links.

Modified build system
    - Removed unused sh init scripts.
    - Removed the lirc_cmdir kernel module from the library list since it has
      been removed from lirc.
    - Added LGPL3 license.
    - Changed default build so that it includes libraries needed for Adobe
      Flash (rather than gnash) when building for MythTV trunk because some
      common Flash AV formats do not work in gnash.
    - Changed image so that it includes /dev/null already created.

Fixed build system
    - Added missing lib/SDL build dependency to lib/agg.
    - Changed master sites for emulators/zsnes and lib/libwiimote so that they
      match the master site used for all other packages that download from
      sourceforge.

      the serial.* lircd.conf files.

Fixed bugs
    - Changed MiniMyth::mythfrontend_networkcontrol so that it does not crash
      when the telnet connection fails.
    - Changed the LIRC devinput lircd.conf files so that they match the format
      found in the lirc-0.8.5pre1.

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 0.20-softpad: version 0.20.2.softpad, release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082,
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07, and
                                                 softpad branch svn 11261 (updated).
    MythTV 0.20:         version 0.20.2,         release-0-20-fixes branch svn 16082, and
                                                 ticket 3035 as of 2007.02.07.
    MythTV 0.21:         version 0.21.0,         release-0-21-fixes branch svn 19778.
    MythTV trunk:        version trunk.19846     trunk svn 19846.

Improved MythTV slave backend support.
    - Added Hauppauge PVR-250 card support
        - Enabled IVTV support in MythTV backend.
        - Added IVTV kernel drivers.
        - Added lircd.conf files for the Hauppauge R808 and Hauppauge A415 remotes
          using the PVR-250 card receiver.
        - Added autoconfiguration of the PVR-250 IR receiver.
    - Added bttv kernel driver.
        - Added the lirc_gpio driver used may cards that use the bttv driver.
    - Added mythcommflag and mythtranscode.
    - Added MM_BACKEND_DEBUG_LEVEL and MM_BACKEND_TUNER_FIRMWARE_FILE_LIST.
    - Added 'Slave Backend Tools' item to 'MiniMyth Tools' for starting,
      stopping, and configuring (launching 'mythtv-setup') the slave backend.
    - Modified the backend init script so that it logs the output of
      mythbackend using syslog.

Modified MythTV
    - Enabled IVTV support in MythTV backend.
    - Patched mythlcdserver so that its priority format is compatible with
      LCDproc 0.5.x.

    - Updated Xine VDPAU support.

Modified kernel
    - Updated unionfs patch.
    - Added bttv kernel driver.
    - Added PVR-250 related kernel drivers (e.g. ivtv).
    - Added Intel Graphics Package 2008Q4 patch for 2.6.28
      <http://intellinuxgraphics.org/2008Q4.html>.
    - Patched kernel so that the LIRC driver lirc_gpio works.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Patched MPlayer SVN with the VDPAU 'line 704 hack' patch.

Modified LIRC
    - Added lircd.conf files for the Hauppauge R808 and Hauppauge A415 remotes
      using the PVR-250 card receiver.
    - Updated to CVS 20090116Z in order to add support for the latest iMON
      devices as well as autodetection
        - This causes /sys/module/lirc_imon/parameters/is_lcd to no longer be
          available, but with autodetection is should no longer be needed.
    - Added iMON lircd.conf file with 64-bit codes in support of the latest
      iMON driver.
    - Enabled lirc_gpio.
    - Added support for MCE keyboard by patching lirc_mceusb2 with a patch

         - Support for LIRC.
    - The driver has not be verified to work.
    - The LIRC support has not been verified to work.
    - The LIRC support has not been integrated into MiniMyth's init system.

Modified Xorg
    - Changed xinit's xserverrc file so that it redirects Xorg's stderr/stdout
      to /dev/null since it is logged to /var/log/Xorg.0.0.log already.

Modified init
    - Added detection of i2c lirc devices.
    - Added support for loading firmware (as long as it is present in
      '/lib/firmware').
    - Added support for detecting and fetching required tuner firmware files.
    - Added MM_BACKEND_TUNER_FIRMWARE_FILE_LIST.
    - Removed user 'root' MythTV configuration files (i.e.
      /root/.mythtv/config.xml and /root/.mythtv/mysql.txt) because all
      MythTV programs (mythbackend, mythfrontend and mythwelcome) run as user
      'minimyth'.
    - Added support for loading coretemp kernel driver on more hardware.
    - Added check for trailing '/' in MM_MINIMYTH_CONF_BOOT_URL.
    - Modified the default values of MM_EXTRAS_URL, MM_THEME_URL and
      MM_THEMEOSD_URL so that it uses 'confro' rather than 'hunt' when the
      root file system is not a squahsfs image.
    - Modified the 'dist' url expansion to that it expands to empty when the
      root file system is not a squashfs image.
    - Stopped changing the gid of the directory tree /srv/www to httpd as it
      is not needed (group and other have the same access) and it causes the
      files to be copied from read-only branch to read-write branch of the
      unionfs union.
    - Changed tftp URLs from using tftp to using curl as the latest curl claims
      to fix the TFTP timeout bugs.
    - Changed how uid's and gid's are set so that we do not set uid's and
      gid's that are already correctly set. This reduces the number of files
      that are copied from the read-only branch to the read-write branch of
      the unionfs union.
    - Changed http gets and puts so that they follow redirects as they did
      before switching from using wget to using curl.
    - Changed perl init scripts so that they use return values rather than
      the /var/log/minimyth.err.log file to trigger failure.
    - Changed perl init scripts so that they do not create
      /var/log/minimyth.err.log.

Modified udev
    - Renamed 06-minimyth-mythtv.rules to 07-minimyth-mythtv.rules.
    - Added 05-minimyth-detect-tuner.rules for detecting tuner cards.
    - Added 06-minimyth-firmware.rules for loading firmware.
    - Renamed mm_uid to mm_persistent.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed a bug that caused there to be no PCI devices in /dev/persistent.
    - Fixed missing DVB support in MythTV 0.20 and 0.20 softpad.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause DHCP to fail to use MM_DHCP_* variables.
    - Fixed a bug that caused perl init scripts to not fail when required file
      was not fetched from the read-only configuration directory.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause perl init scripts to create the wrong value
      of MM_HARDWARE_KERNEL_MODULES.
    - Added missing tfp410.so Xorg module needed by the intel Xorg driver.
    - Applied
      <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/anholt/drm-intel.git;a=commit;h=2052746fc8397130c120f0194a89938b0b62b6cb>
      to the 2.6.26 kernel (already in the 2.6.27 and newer kernels) to fix
      the problem mentioned here
      <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2008-October/039591.html>.
    - Fixed a bug that would cause MM_X_MODELINE_0, MM_X_MODELINE_1 and
      MM_X_MODELINE_2 to fail with perl init scripts.
    - Fixed bug that identified MM_PLUGIN_DVD_ENABLED as obsolete even though
      it is not.
    - Fixed a bug in LIRC that caused it to create the wrong sysfs device
      link, which prevented access to bInterfaceNumber.
    - Fixed a bug with the security init script not setting the ownership
      permissions on home direcotry for the user 'minimyth' after set the uid
      and gid for the user 'minimyth'.
    - Added missing vmware video driver dependency: shadowfb.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented LCDd.conf from being fetched from the conf
      directory when using perl init scripts.

Modified build system
    - Modified include file lists so that LIRC drivers are included
      individually rather than including all the LIRC drivers.
    - Modified include file lists so that lirc_gpio and lirc_i2c drivers are
      included only when the backend software is included.
    - Changed mksquashfs so that it uses more conservative settings. I hope
      that this will reduce the chance of creating bad squashfs images.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed lib/libftdi so that it does detect the system's boost library and
      so that it does not require the boost library even though it is
      included in MiniMyth.
    - Fixed a bug in kernel-2.6.28/linux that could cause packages that
      include linux/serial.h to fail to compile.
    - Fixed a bug when compiling MythTV 0.20 or 0.21 with the 2.6.28 linux
      headers by backporting MythTV SVN changeset 19245.
    - Cleaned up xorg-7.3/Mesa nd xorg-7.4/Mesa patches.

Modified init scripts
    - Obsoleted sh init scripts. MM_INIT_TYPE=sh will no longer work.
    - Improved perl init script error messages, including minimyth.pm.
    - Cleaned up 'error:' and 'warning:' prefixes in error messages for perl
      init scripts.
    - Improved messages logged when fetching files using perl init scripts.
    - Improved handling of 'dist:' URLs when using local boot.
    - Switched from 'require {package};' to 'use {package} ();' in perl init
      scirpts when possible.

Modified MiniMyth configuration
    - Obsoleted MM_WIIMOTE_ENABLED.

Modified MiniMyth.pm
    - Removed member functions 'url_confro_get', 'url_confrw_get',
      'url_dist_get', 'url_file_get', 'url_http_get', 'url_hunt_get' and
      'url_tftp_get'. Scripts should have been using 'url_get'.
    - Removed member functions 'url_confrw_put', 'url_file_get', 'url_http_get'
      and 'url_tftp_get'. Scripts should have been using 'url_put'.
    - Added 'url_expand' for exanding a URL into a prioritized list of URLs.
    - Changed 'url_get' and 'url_put' so that they use 'url_expand'.

Modified kernel
    - Added the at11e Ethernet driver.

Modified Xorg
    - Combined keyboard and mouse udev detection rules into event detection
      rule.
    - Added wiimote to detected event devices.
    - Added support for numerous event devices in xorg.conf rather than just
      one keyboard and one mouse.
    - Added vmware video driver to the default binary image.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Modified init so that it configures MythTV to use xv rather than vdpau
      when MM_VIDEO_DECODER='vdpau' and MythTV is either version 0.20.x or
      version 0.21.x.
    - Updated FFmpeg VDPAU support.
    - Updated MPlayer VDPAU support.
    - Updated Xine VDPAU support.

Modified Wiimote
    - Improved checking for whether or not a Wiimote is in use before
      initializing during init.
    - Enabled remote LED to indicate remote number.

Modified udev rules
    - Prepended kernel device name (without instance) to the persistent device
      link. This is needed for hardware that creates multiple device types (e.g.
      the Wiimote).
    - Added persistent device links for the Wiimote.
    - Removed obsolete udev rules and script that where used used create
      quasi-persistent input device names.
    - Changed the location of bash from /usr/bin to /bin.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed a bug that prevented Wiimote devices from working.
    - Fixed a bug that caused wrong Wiimote configuration file to be selected
      when the perl init scripts were being used.
    - Fixed a bug that caused MPlayer configuration to fail when using the
      perl init scripts.

      enabled in minimyth.conf but no bluetooth device was present.
    - Fixed a bug that cuased MM_VIDEO_RESIZE_ENABLED to default to 'no'
      rather than ''.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the DHCP client to not restart correctly
      when being restarted so that it would use the DHCP override variables in
      minimyth.conf.
    - Fixed a bug where error messages were logged with the deprecated 'error'
      level rather than the 'err' level.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the fakeroot script to use the wrong shell.
    - Fixed spurious warnings in the web.pm and x.pm init scripts.
    - Fixed a bug that would cause a non-bootable USB HID device to not be
      detected as a valid event input device for X.
    - Fixed an error in the documentation of MM_THEME_FILE_MENU_ADD.

Modified build system
    - Enabled building of wmgui in utils/cwiid package.
    - Removed MythStream parsers that claim to be perl but are actually bash.

Fixed build system
    - Patched lib/bluez, lib/dbus and net/portmap so that their binaries are
      recognized as executables rather than shared objects by disabling gcc pie
      or replacing it with gcc pic.
    - Fixed a bug in package xorg-7.4/xorg-server's Makefile that caused it to
