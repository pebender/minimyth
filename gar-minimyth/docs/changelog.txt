    Updated system/zoneinfo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.7:

Updated init
    Changed init to start logging and telnet before fetching and running
        minimyth.conf and minimyth.script. This allows logs and remote access
        to the MiniMyth front end as early as possible.
    Changed syslog to get the remote log server address from DHCP rather than
        minimyth.conf.
    Added a check to make sure that MiniMyth can connect to the Myth database.
    Changed init to not start a console or tty1 shell because they interfere
        with the bootsplash screen. However, there are now shells on tty2, tty3,
        tty4 and tty5 (and X is now on tty6).
    Stopped disabling X when debugging is enabled. If you want to disable X,
        then use MM_X_ENABLED=no.

Updated minimyth.conf
    Replaced MM_SOUND with MM_AUDIO_TYPE.
    Obsoleted MM_SOUND.
    Obsoleted MM_SYSLOG_SERVER.
    Added MM_VIDEO_ASPECT_RATIO to set the video aspect ratio. Right now, this
        is only used to control the aspect ratio for MPlayer. However, in the
        future, it may be use to clean up some of the MM_X controls.
    Added MM_VIDEO_DEINTERLACE_ENABLED to enable bob deinterlacing. This
        controls bob deinterlacing in MythTV, Xine and MPlayer.

Updated MPlayer
    Added Chris Audley's XvMC fallback patch (version 2). This enables MPlayer
        to fall back to a different video output and codec when the file
        cannot be played using XvMC with MPEG2 accelaration.
    Updated the MPlayer configuration file (/root/.mplayer/config) to enable
        MPlayer to take advantage of the XvMC fallback patch.

Added MythNews support
    Enabled the MythNews plugin.
    Added MM_MYTHNEWS_ENABLED to minimyth.conf.

Added Theora support
    Added Theora for philisophical reasons. There is no Theora content (yet).
        However, like Vorbis, Theora is a completely open codec, which is
        something that should be supported.
    Added package lib/libtheora.
    Enabled Theora support packages myth/mplayer and myth/xine-lib.

Updated packages

    Updated devel/bison.
    Updated devel/libtool.
    Updated kernel/drm.
    Updated kernel/linux.

    Updated lib/libdrm.

    Updated utils/util-linux.
    Updated X11/SDL.

Changes since 0.18.1.6:

Updated X support
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_X_DISPLAYSIZE_X and MM_X_DISPLAYSIZE_Y to
        control the horizonatal display size and the vertical display size
        respectively.

Made root file system read/write
    Used pivot_root to make root file system read/write.

Changed X window manager
    Changed X window manager from ratpoison to aewm, because ratpoison was
        causing crashes with new Unichrome driver and with upcoming X11R6.9.
    Disabled X window manager by default, because MythTV "GUI X offset" and
        "GUI Y offset" settings do not work when the X window manager running.
    Added packages X11/aewm and X11/lesstif.

Updated Mesa support
    Changed X11/X11 so that it no longer builds libOSMesa.
    Added packages X11/Mesa and lib/libdrm.

        resolution and vertical refresh rate respectively. Using
        MM_X_RESOLUTION_X and MM_X_RESOLUTION_Y rather than MM_X_MODE

    Updated mm_message_output so that it writes to syslog as well.
