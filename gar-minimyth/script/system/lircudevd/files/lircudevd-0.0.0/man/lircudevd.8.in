.SH AVAILABILITY
Any GNU/Linux system with udev (at least version 136) and uinput (at least driver version 0.3) support.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBlircudevd\fR is an LIRC daemon for input devices that
supports multiple input devices at the same time,
discovers the input devices to be handled using udev,
maps keyboard shortcuts to single keys (e.g. ctrl+shift+KEY_B to KEY_REWIND), and
passes through mouse/joystick events.
.LP
A keyboard shortcut consists of
zero or more lock keys (capslock, numlock and scrolllock)
zero or more modifier keys (ctrl, shift, alt and meta) and
one base key (non-lock and non-modifier key).
.LP
Udev signals that \fBlircudevd\fR should use a device as an \fBlircudevd\fR input device
by setting the environment variable \fBlircudevd.enable\fR to true.
Udev provides \fBlircudevd\fR with the name of the key map file to use for mapping the keyboard shortcuts for the device
by setting the environment variable \fBlircudevd.keymap\fR to the name of the key map file in the \fBlircudevd\fR key map directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fB\-\-help\fR
Print the help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR \fB\-\-version\fR
Display the program version and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Increase the output message verbosity.
This option can appear up to three times.
The more often it appears, the more verbose the message output.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fB\-\-foreground\fR
Run \fBlircudevd\fR in the foreground rather than in the background.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR \fB\-\-keymap=dir\fR
Look for device keymap files in directory \fBdirectory\fR rather than directory @KEYMAP_DIR@.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fB\-\-socket=socket\fR
Create the lircd socket \fBsocket\fR rather than lircd socket @LIRCD_SOCKET@.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fB\-\-mode=mode\fR
Create the lircd socket with mode \fBmode\fR rather than with mode 0666.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fB\-\-release=suffix\fR
Generate key release events with \fBsuffix\fR appended to the key name.
.SH FILES
.I @KEYMAP_DIR@/*.keymap
.RS
The per-device key map files.
See \fBlircudevd.keymap (5)\fR for further details.
.I @includedir@/linux/input.h
.RS
The Linux input event device header file in which the key and button codes associated with the key event type are define.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.SH BUGS
.SH CAVEATS
.LP
\fBlircudevd\fR 
consumes all keys that it associates with
either a lock or modifier key token.
Therefore, when a key associated with
either a lock or modifier key token is received,
it is not forwarded to either the lircd socket or the mouse/joystick output device.
.LP
When a key press event is mapped to a value,
any intermediate key repeat events and the final key release event associated with the key press event
are mapped to the same value.
.LP
\fBlircudevd\fR 
supports a subset of the Linux input event types and event codes,
and silently discards the event types and codes that it does not support.
It supports 
It has complete support for
synchronization events (EV_SYN),
key/button events (EV_KEY),
relative axes events (EV_REL),
absolute axes events (EV_ABS)
It has partial support for LED events (EV_LED),
supporting the codes for capslock (LED_CAPSL), numlock (LED_NUML) and scrolllock (LED_SCROLLL).
All other Linux input event types and event codes are not supported.
