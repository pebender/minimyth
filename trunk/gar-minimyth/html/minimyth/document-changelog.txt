Modified init
    - Removed MM_PLUGIN_DVD_ENABLED and MM_PLUGIN_PHONE_ENABLED as they are no
      longer used.
    - Modified udev init scripts so that they do not change the device name as
      udevd no longer considers changing the device name acceptable behavior.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer multi-threading patches.

Modified game emulators
    - Replaced sdlmame with mame as sdlmame has been merged into mame.

Modified LIRC
