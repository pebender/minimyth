Changes since 73 (2010-09-21):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV trunk: version trunk.26424 trunk svn 26433.
    MythTV 0.23:  version 0.23.1,     release-0-23-fixes branch svn 26434.
    MythTV 0.22:  version 0.22.0,     release-0-22-fixes branch svn 25328.

Modified init
    - Removed MM_PLUGIN_DVD_ENABLED and MM_PLUGIN_PHONE_ENABLED as they are no
      longer used.
    - Added MM_PLUGIN_NETVISION_ENABLED as the MiniMyth build system has
      support for the MythNetvision plugin. Note, the MythNetvision plugin is
      not included in the default MiniMyth binary.
    - Modified init scripts so that MM_THEMEOSD_NAME and MM_THEMEOSD_URL are
      not used for versions of MythTV beyond 0.23.
    - Modified udev init scripts so that they do not change the device name as
      udevd no longer considers changing the device name acceptable behavior.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer multi-threading patches.
    - Updated the Adobe Flash Player fetch and save command so that it fetches
      the "Flash Player 'Square' Preview Release" (P1 from 2010.09.15).

Modified game emulators
    - Replaced sdlmame with mame as sdlmame has been merged into mame.

Modified LIRC
    - Removed the Sony BD remote patch from Bluez because MiniMyth supports
      this remote using bdremote-ng.

Modified kernel
    - Removed OSS emulation drivers as it was only used by MythPhone.
    - Removed video camera drivers as they were only used by MythPhone.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed a bug that caused the episode ID to not show up in the watch
      recordings screen under MythTV 0.23 and trunk.

Modified build system
    - Changed lists so that /usr/share/mythtv/myth* plugin directories are not
      included unless the corresponding plugin is included.

Fixed build system
    - Fixed a autoreconf bug in lib/libxml2 uncovered by switching all
      possible packages that were dependent on lib/expat to be dependent on
      lib/libxml2.
    - Fixed a dependency bug in perl/perl-XML-Parser uncovered by switching all
      possible packages that were dependent on lib/expat to be dependent on
      lib/libxml2.
