Modified init
    - Added MM_X_FETCH_XBINDKEYSRC.
    - Added MM_X_XKB_RULES, MM_X_XKB_LAYOUT, MM_X_XKB_VARIANT, MM_X_XKB_MODEL
      and MM_X_XKB_OPTIONS.
    - Changed the default from MM_HULU_REMOTE to 'devinput' to 'mceusb' because
      'devinput' is the default remote name for eventlircd.
    - Changed hotplug udev scripts so that they are disabled initially.
    - Added the init script hotplug to enable the hotplug udev scripts.
    - Changed DHCP init so that it uses the first rather than last connected
      interface detected.
    - Changed DHCP so that it uses a found interface rather than eth0 when no
      connected interface is detected.
    - Changed DHCP init so that one-shot DHCP is not run when the MiniMyth
      boot directory is configured as local using MM_MINIMYTH_BOOT_URL on the
      boot line.
    - Moved determining of network interface from dhcp.pm to MM_NETWORK.pm.
    - Moved functions that process configuration variable from init/conf.pm to
      init/conf/base.pm.

Improved MythTV slave backend support
    - Added firmware autodetection for the Technotrend-Budget/Hauppauge
      WinTV-NOVA-T DVB.

Modified mediaplayers
    - Removed gnash.
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer multi-threading patches.
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer VAAPI patches.
    - Removed VLC's VDPAU support because the patch no longer works and VDPAU
      support it reported to be accessable through VLC's VAAPI support.
    - Disabled FFmpeg's encoder ability as no MiniMyth functions use it.
    - Removed FFmpeg's libogg, libvorbis and libtheora support.
    - Removed MPlayers's libmpeg2, libvorbis and libtheora support as FFmpeg
      should be able to handle decoding.
    - Removed VLC's libmpeg2, libvorbis and libtheora support as FFmpeg should
      be able to handle decoding.
    - Removed Xine's libvorbis and libtheora support as FFmpeg should be able
      to handle decoding.

Modified transcoder
    - Added xvid support as Myth's mtd uses it by default.
    - Removed libogg, libvorbis and libtheora codecs. FFmpeg should be able
      to handle decoding and Myth's mtd uses divx5/xvid by default, so it is
      unlikely that anyone is using the encoding.
    - Removed libmpeg2 decoder as FFmpeg should be able to handle decoding.

Modified LIRC
    - Switched to eventlircd for final lircd output.
        - Makes it easier to handle multiple remote controls.
        - Makes it easier to handle remotes that generate keyboard shortcuts.
        - Makes it easier to handle remotes that are not present at boot time
          (e.g. Sony PS3 Blu-ray Disk remote control).
        - Makes it possible to handle hotplugging.
        - NOTE: if you are using a custom lircd.conf file, then you must make
          sure that the key names are in the LIRC namespace (which you can
          find by running 'irrecord --show-namespace') and start with KEY_
          not BTN_.
        - NOTE: if you are using a custom lircrc file, then you must make
          sure that the entries are not restricted to a specific remotes
          using remote=<remote-name>, as eventlircd does not forward remote
          names.
    - Switched from udev based detection to udev based hotplug.
    - Added support for the Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc remote control.
    - Changed LIRC to use syslog rather than its own log file.
    - Changed some of the key names in lircd.conf and lircrc files so that
      they are valid LIRC namespace key names:
        - Changed KEY_ASPECTRATIO  to KEY_ZOOM.
          KEY_ZOOM maps to both the "Aspect Ratio" and "Zoom" buttons. KEY_ZOOM
          controls the aspect ratio.
        - Changed KEY_IMAGE to KEY_MEDIA.
          KEY_MEDIA maps to the "My Pictures" key.
        - Changed KEY_AUDIO to KEY_MP3.
        - Changed KEY_GUIDE (which is not in linux/input.h) to KEY_PROGRAM.
    - Patched LIRC so that lircd's uinput output supports all keys and buttons.
    - Simplified lircrc by moving custom key mapping for MCE and Hauppauge
      remotes from lircrc to lircd.conf.
    - Simplified lircrc by removing MCE shortcut key mapping from lircrc as
      they should be handled by either lircd or eventlircd.
    - Simplified lircrc by removing KEY_n and KEY_KPn as KEY_n and KEY_KPn
      should be mapped to KEY_NUMERIC_n by either lircd or eventlircd.
    - Patched bdremote-ng used for bdremote support so that it has an event
      device output.
    - Moved event device support from lircd to eventlircd.
    - Modified scripts so that they enable wake-on-usb using /sys rather than
      /proc.
    - Removed all devinput lircd.conf files as these devices are handled by
      eventlircd directly.
    - Moved repeat filtering from lircrc to eventlircd.

Modified Xorg
    - Added nouveau driver.
    - Changed Xorg so that it uses its built in extension loading.

Modified kernel
    - Replaced ext2 and ext3 drivers with ext4 drivers as the ext4 drivers are
      supposed to be backward compatible with the ext2 and ext3 drivers.
    - Added atl1c Ethernet driver.
    - Added ath3k Bluetooth driver.
        - Included the ath3k-1.hw firmware as well, but this may removed in
          the future in favor of using MM_FIRMWARE_FILE_LIST.
    - Added the p4-clockmod.ko frequency scaling driver used by the Intel Atom
      processor.
    - Chenged to the CFQ IO scheduler as the one MiniMyth was using was
      removed in 2.6.33.
    - Disabled /proc/acpi/event as the new version of acpid no longer needs
      it.
    - Enabled kernel mode setting by default for the intel driver.
    - Patched via-rhine so that avoid_D3 can be set at runtime.
    - Updated unionfs patch.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed a bug that could cause XvMC-VLD to crash MythTV.
    - Fixed a bug that caused mm_sleep and mm_sleep_on_ss to output an error
      messages when either mm_external_power_off or mm_external_power_on were
      not present.
    - Fixed a bug in the checking of mythfrontend location state when using
      MythTV 0.22. MythTV changed from returning 'MainMenu' to returning
      'mainmenu' when the location is queried through the network control
      interface.
    - Fixed a bug in MythStream's YouTube parser in MythTV trunk caused by a
      change in YouTube's web page format.
    - Fixed a bug that caused MythStream to crash in MythTV trunk due to
      streams.res not being present.
    - Fixed a bug where init would reject MM_X_TV_TYPE='PAL-D' for nvidia
      driver.
    - Fixed a bug that would cause Adobe Flash Player to crash on some sites
      (e.g. www.cnn.com) due to missing libraries that are opened using dlopen.
    - Backported serveral WebKit fixes to Qt 4.6.x in order to fix numerous 
      Adobe Flash related crashes and video playback failures. Unfortunatly,
      there continue to be window scaling problems that I have not been able
      to resolve.
   - Fixed a bug that caused MiniMyth to fail to detect the input device
      usb device with VendorId=0003 and ProductId=0419 as an LIRC device.
    - Fixed a bug in MM_LIRC.pm that made it impossible to configure LIRC to
      use the udp driver.
    - Added workaround in <http://svn.mythtv.org/trac/ticket/7603>.
    - Fixed a bug in saving game files that would cause it to claim to fail even
      when it did not.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the Hulu menu item to not be deleted in MythTV
      0.22 and trunk when huludesktop is not present.
    - Fixed a bug that caused Hulu desktop to not be able to save settings.
    - Changed web based directory listing so that it reports the encoding as
      UTF-8.
    - Added gconv's UTF-16 module so that Qt4's unicode check does not disable
      unicode.
    - Generated and added /usr/lib/locale/*.UTF-8 directories so that UTF-8
      filenames are not ignored by Myth.
    - Fixed multiple bugs that caused MM_FONT_FILE_TTF_DELETE to behave
      differently than how it behaved when the init scripts where sh rather
      than perl.
    - Fixed a bug that caused third mode switching width to not get set.
    - Fixed a bug in valid TV types when using Intel driver.
    - Fixed a bug that caused MM_PLUGIN_INFORMATION_CENTER_ENABLED='no' and
      MM_PLUGIN_OPTICAL_DISK_ENABLED='no' to fail on MythTV 0.22 and newer.
    - Fixed lirc configuration bug that caused VLC volume control to not work.
    - Fixed bug that would cause Qt4 to attempt to load the wrong loader
      (although it did not appear to cause a problem).

Modified build system
    - Added initial nouveau driver support.
    - Made perl mandatory as it is required by MiniMyth's init scripts.
        - Removed perl from mm_SOFTWARE.
    - Enabled gcc's graphite support.
        - Added devel-tainted/* to be built it before building devel/*. This
          was done because ppl needed for gcc's graphite support must be built
          using the same compiler as gcc yet must be built before gcc. It is
          called tainted because the binutils, gmp, mpc and mpfr packages in
          devel-tainted are not built using MiniMyth's gcc.
    - Stopped disabling tree-vectorize.
    - Enabled gcc's graphite support (on packages that do exhibit problems
      when it is enabled).
    - Enabled gcc's link time optimization (on packages that do exhibit
      problems when it is enabled).
    - Switched from the bfd (aka ld) linker to the gold linker (on packages
      that do exhibit problems when it is used) in order to support additional
      link time optimization.
    - Added 64-bit Intel Atom optimization support.
    - Cleaned up the running of autotools.
    - Changed build system so that it sets SHELL (used by make) and
      CONFIG_SHELL (used by autotools).
    - Changed build system so that it uses the build system's bash shell for
      autoconf and libtool.

Fixed build system
    - Modified the configure arguments in lib/fontconfig's Makefile so that its
      configure script will not look for fonts elsewhere as this will cause it
      to look for font paths on the local system.
    - Modified X11/xscreensaver's Makefile to work around a problem caused by
      by xscreensaver's broken use of intltools.
    - Modified X11/libva's Makefile so that it does not install libva-compat.la.
    - Modified gtk/gtk+ so that it compiles with minimal rather than no
      debugging as doing so stops (at least some) crashing of MythTV 0.22's
      MythBrowser when displaying Adobe Flash.
    - Added a work around to a bug in AM_PATH_SDL that causes packages that
      require SDL to find the wrong sdl-config.
    - Updated lib/libacl and lib/libattr master site URLs.
    - Changed MASTER_SITES pointing to ftp.gnu.org so that that they use
      http://ftp.gnu.org rather than ftp://ftp.gnu.org.
    - Fixed a udev build problem on Fedora 12 caused by the udev using the
      system's linux/input.h file rather than the cross linux/input.h file.
    - Fixed a nss problem on Fedora 12 caused by lib/nss not exposing a API
      by default that is required by Fedora 12.
    - Fixed a bug in X11/xvattr that caused it to not use CFLAGS.
    - Fixed a bug in X11/xmacro that caused it to not use CPPFLAGS or
      LDFLAGS.
    - Fixed a bug in system/bdremote-ng that caused it to not use CPPFLAGS.
    - Fixed a bug in system/powernowd that caused it to not use CPPFLAGS or
      LDFLAGS.
    - Added CFLAGS to LDFLAGS in system/acpid since the acpid's make file does
      not include them when linking.
    - Added CFLAGS to LDFLAGS in system/sysvinit since the sysvinit's make
      file does not include them when linking.
    - Added CFLAGS to LDFLAGS in system/kbdd since the kbdd's make file does
      not include them when linking.
