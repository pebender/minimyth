Modified mediaplayers
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer multi-threading patches.
    - Updated FFmpeg and MPlayer VAAPI patches.
    - Updated Xine VDPAU patch.

Fixed bugs
    - Fixed a bug that caused mm_sleep and mm_sleep_on_ss to output an error
      messages when either mm_external_power_off or mm_external_power_on were
      not present.
    - Fixed a bug in the checking of mythfrontend location state when using
      MythTV 0.22. MythTV changed from returning 'MainMenu' to returning
      'mainmenu' when the location is queried through the network control
      interface.
    - Fixed a bug in MythStream's YouTube parser in MythTV trunk caused by a
      change in YouTube's web page format.
    - Fixed a bug that caused MythStream to crash in MythTV trunk due to
      streams.res not being present.
    - Fixed a bug where init would reject MM_X_TV_TYPE='PAL-D' for nvidia
      driver.

Fixed build system
    - Modified the configure arguments in lib/fontconfig's Makefile so that its
      configure script will not look for fonts elsewhere as this will cause it
      to look for font paths on the local system.
    - Modified X11/xscreensaver's Makefile to work around a problem caused by
      by xscreensaver's broken use of intltools.
    - Modified X11/libva's Makefile so that it does not install libva-compat.la.

Updated packages

    Updated lib/bluez.
    Updated lib/ffmpeg.
    Updated lib/libexif.
    Updated lib/libusb.
