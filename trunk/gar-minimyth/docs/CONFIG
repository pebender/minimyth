Configuration

MiniMyth can be configured at boot time on a per MiniMyth frontend basis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration File Locations

By default, MiniMyth pulls its configuration files from the same TFTP server
that is used to PXE boot MiniMyth. If the the PXE boot loader (pxelinux.0) is in
a directory '<dir>', then MiniMyth looks for configuration files first in the
directory '<dir>/conf/<hostname>' and second in the directory '<dir>/conf',
where <hostname> is the hostname of the MiniMyth frontend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration Files

The main configuration file is 'minimyth.conf'. An example 'minimyth.conf'
configuration file can be found in the 'docs' directory.

The main configuration script is 'minimyth.script'. This is a shell script that
will be executed by MiniMyth after it has completed downloading all the
configuration files from the TFTP server, and after it has mounted extras
(if applicable). You can use it to do things such as install additional kernel
modules.

In addition to the main configuration file and script, you can override the
following MiniMyth configuration files:
    lircd.conf - /etc/lircd.conf
    lircrc     - The lircrc file used by mythtv and mplayer
    localtime  - /etc/localtime
    xinitrc    - /root/.xinitrc
    xorg.conf  - /etc/X11/xorg.conf
