# MythTV
#
# The 'PgUp' and 'PgDown' are mapped to CHANNEL+ and CHANNEL- respectively.
# This enables page up and page down support in list boxes. This should not
# cause any loss of functionality since 'Up' and 'Down' also act as channel up
# and channel down within MythTV.
#
# ')' and '(' are used for FORWARD and REWIND respectively. This allows
# fast forward and rewind to work in MythMusic with losing the page up and 
# page down support in list boxes. Therefore, you will need to change the
# following MythTV keybindings:
#       context      |  action    |  keylist
#     ---------------+------------+-----------
#       Music        |  FFWD      |  )
#       Music        |  RWND      |  (
#       Stream       |  FORWARD   |  )
#       Stream       |  REWIND    |  (
#       TV Playback  |  SEEKFFWD  |  )
#       TV Playback  |  SEEKRWND  |  (
#
# Non-obvious key mappings:
#     START  : Menu
#     LIVE_TV: Switch Capture Card
#     MORE   : Info
