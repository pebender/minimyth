Introduction

This is GAR MiniMyth. It uses a variant of the GAR build system
<http://www.lnx-bbc.org> to build a variant of MiniMyth
<http://www.linpvr.org>. MiniMyth is a Linux distribution that turns a
diskless Via EPIA M series computer into a Myth <http://www.mythtv.org>
frontend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites

This build system assumes that you are building on an i586 compatible computer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation

Configure the build system with your settings in
  script/minimyth.conf.mk

Clean the entire build by doing the following:
  make clean

Download the distribution files by doing the following:
  make garchive
The downloaded distribution files will be stored in the directory 'source'.

Build MiniMyth by doing the following:
  cd script/meta/minimyth
  make build

Build and install MiniMyth by doing the following:
  cd script/meta/minimyth
  make install

Everything, with the exception of the install, can and should be done using
a non-root account. The install process needs to perform the following
operations as root:
  (1) change the owner of the directories and files in the rootfs image to root,
  (2) copy the kernel and the rootfs image to the TFTP server directory.
As a result, 'make install' will prompt you for the root password.
